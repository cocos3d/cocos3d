/**
 * MainLayer covers the whole screen. Within this layer, the user can add or remove a square
 * grid of CC3Layers, by clicking buttons to increase or decrease the number of CC3Layers.
 *
 * Each CC3Layer contains a separate 3D scene. Each 3D scene contains a separate camera and
 * light, and so can be controlled independently. The light is positioned differently in 
 * each little scene.
 *
 * Each scene contains a single main object. The object is chosen randomly, from
 * a collection of templates, so each 3D scene contains a different object. The
 * overall effect is a grid of tiles, with each tile displaying a single 3D object.
 *
 * Within each little 3D scene, the user can touch the main object and then move a finger
 * to rotate the object. When the user raises the finger, the 3D object briefly glows, 
 * demonstrating touch selection and control when multiple separate 3D scenes are displayed.
 *
 * As demonstrated by the touch control, the object in each tile scene is a separate CC3MeshNode,
 * and can be controlled independently of similar objects in other tiles. But since each of these
 * objects is created from a template copy, there is only one copy of the underlying mesh data, 
 * thereby preserving memory.
 *
 * When drawing this main layer, each 3D layer and scene must be visited to be drawn. There 
 * are several techniques that can be used to optimize performance under these conditions.
 *
 * Of prime importance is reducing the number of times the color and depth buffers are cleared
 * by each 3D scene. By default, the depth buffer is cleared on every transition between the 
 * 2D and 3D scenes, to ensure that the 2D and 3D artifacts draw in the order expected.
 *
 * For many app configurations, this is not really needed. Here, we turn off depth testing 
 * in the 2D scene, so that any 2D nodes will be drawn over the 3D scene. We also tell the 
 * 3D scene not to clear the depth buffer between each transition between 2D and 3D. Except
 * in the most complicated situations, this should be suitable for most apps.
