/**
 * Pre-loads certain assets, such as shader programs, and certain textures, prior to the
 * scene being displayed.
 *
 * Much of the scene is loaded on a background thread, while the scene is visible. However,
 * the handling of some assets on the background thread can interrupt the main rendering thread.
 *
 * The GL drivers often leave the final stages of shader compilation and configuration until
 * the first time the shader program is used to render an object. This can often introduce a
 * short, unwanted pause if the shader program is loaded while the scene is running.
 *
 * Unfortunately, although resources such as models, textures, and shader programs can be loaded
 * on a background thread, the final stages of shader programs compilation must be performed on
 * the primary rendering thread. Because of this, the only way to avoid an unwanted pause while
 * a shader program compilation is finalized is to therefore perform all shader program loading
 * prior to the scene being displayed, including shader programs that may not be required until
 * additional content is loaded later in the scene on a background thread.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the shader programs will be available when the models are loaded
 * at a later point in the scene (usually via background loading), the cache must be configured
 * to retain the loaded shader programs even though they will not immediately be used to display
 * any models. This is done by turning on the value of the class-side isPreloading property.
 *
 * In addition, the automatic creation of mipmaps on larger textures, particularly cube-map 
 * textures (which require a set of six mipmaps), can cause excessive work for the GPU in
 * the background, which can spill over into a delay on the primary rendering thread.
 *
 * As a result, a large cube-map texture is loaded here and cached, for later access once
 * the model that uses it is loaded in the background.

 *
 * The non-premultiplied alpha texture is a PNG file with the special file-extension PPNG. 
 * This is a normal PNG file, but the renamed extension will stop Xcode from modifying the file
 * to pre-multiply the alpha during app building. The PPNG file is loaded with a custom image
 * loader, again, to avoid iOS pre-multiplying the texture content during image loading. 
 * This allows the texture to appear exactly as it was created. This is an important feature
 * when loading textures that contain custom content, such as normal-maps, light-maps, shininess,
 * weightings, etc. See the notes for the CC3STBImage useForFileExtensions property to learn 
 * more about these special file extensions.

/**
 * Adds a bump-mapped floating purple head to the scene, suitable for running under either
 * OpenGL ES 1.1 or OpenGL ES 2.0.
 *
 * Bump-mapping under OpenGL ES 1.1 is much more limited than the techniques available under
 * OpenGL ES 2.0. This example demonstrates the technique for OpenGL ES 1.1. Under OpenGL ES 1.1,
 * the normals contained in the bump-mapping texture must be specified in model-space coordinates.
 *
 * This example also runs correctly under OpenGL ES 2.0, but is not the recommended technique.
 * Under OpenGL ES 2.0, your model should include vertex tangent content, and the normals in
 * your texture should be specified in tangent-space (which is much easier). When using vertex
 * tangents, none of the texture unit configuration below is required, nor is the light tracker
 * required, as the GLSL shader code handles the texture lookups and normal mapping directly.
 * See the addEtchedMask method for an example of using vertex tangent content.
 *
 * Bump-mapping works by applying a texture that contains normal data instead of colors. This allows
 * us to apply a different normal to every pixel of the texture, instead of only at the vertices.
 * This allows us to simulate 3D surface at a resolution much higher than the vertices permit.
 * 
 * The floating head has much higher 3D definitional resolution that provided by the
 * relatively low vertex count mesh. The mesh only contains 153 vertices.
 *
 * You'll notice that the light shadowing changes correctly as the light moves up and
 * down, and as you move the camera around, which causes the head to rotate to follow you.
