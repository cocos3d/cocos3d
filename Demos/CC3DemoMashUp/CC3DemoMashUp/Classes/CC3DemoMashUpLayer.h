/**
 * A sample application-specific CC3Layer subclass that allows the user to interact
 * with the 3D scene using either gestures or overlay controls such as joysticks
 * and buttons.
 * 
 * By default, this layer uses gestures to interact with the 3D nodes. You can turn gestures
 * off by setting shouldUseGestures to NO in the initializeControls method of this class.
 *
 * With gestures off, this layer and scene revert to using basic touch events to interact
 * with the 3D scene. Normally, you would use one or the other technique. Both are provided
 * in this app to demonstrate user interaction using either gestures or touch events.
