#import "CC3Scene.h"

/**
 * A CC3Scene that is specialized to display only a single main node, and is
 * optimized so that many TileScenes can be displayed on the screen simultaneouly.
 *
 * Each tile scene contains its own camera and lamp, so that different perspectives
 * and lighting conditions can be applied to each TileScene.
 * 
 * To simplify using this scene with different main objects, the camera automatically
 * focuses on and frames the main object when the scene first opens up.
 *
 * Each TileScene supports touch events. The main node can be rotated by dragging
 * a finger across the tile. In addition, when the finger is lifted, if it is
 * touching the main node when released, the main node will briefly glow. This
 * demonstrates the ability to select nodes from touches across multiple 3D scenes.
 *
 * In addition, some nodes should be colored and others not. This is enabled by
 * adding a new property to CC3Node through an extention category. This extension
 * property makes use of the userData property available to all subclasses of
 * CC3Identifiable. This demonstrates the use of the userData property to avoid
 * having to create customized subclasses of CC3Node to add state data to 3D
 * artifacts.
