/**
 * This application-specific CC3Scene provides a platform for testing and displaying
 * various performance-related aspects of cocos3d.
 *
 * Using buttons, the user can select one of various node types, and determine how
 * many copies of that node should be added to the 3D scene. Those copies are laid
 * out in a square grid within the scene. This app then collects various statistics
 * about the performance of the 3D scene. This customized CC3Layer extracts these
 * statistics and display them in real-time.
 *
 * Using another button, the user can also select whether the nodes in the scene are
 * animated or not. Animating the nodes adds load because the transformMatrix of each
 * node must be updated during each update.
 *
 * This layer displays the following performance statistics:
 *
 * Drawing:
 *   - frames per second
 *   - count of nodes visited during drawing per frame
 *   - count of nodes drawn per frame
 *   - count of GL draw calls made to the GL engine per frame
 *   - count of primitive faces presented to the GL engine per frame
 *
 * Updating:
 *   - updates per second
 *   - count of nodes updated per update pass
 *   - count of nodes whose transformMatrix was recalculated per update pass
 *
 * There are also two joystick controls that allow the user to control the 3D camera.
 * By moving the camera, the user can move some of the coped nodes out of view, and
 * can see the impact it makes on drawing performance, as those nodes are culled,
 * and not presented to the GL engine for drawing.
