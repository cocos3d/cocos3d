/**
 * This application-specific CC3Scene provides a platform for testing and displaying
 * various performance-related aspects of cocos3d.
 *
 * The user can select one of various node types, and determine how many copies of
 * that node should be added to the 3D scene. Those copies are laid out in a square
 * grid within the scene. This app then collects various statistics about the
 * performance of the 3D scene. The customized CC3Layer can then extract these
 * statistics and display them in real-time.
 *
 * The user can also select whether the nodes in the scene are animated or not.
 * Animating the nodes adds load because the transformMatrix of each node must be
 * updated during each update.
 *
 * The statistics that are collected are available automatically in any cocos3d
 * application. You can collect performance statistics on your own application
 * by setting and managing an instance of CC3PerformanceStatistics or one of its
 * subclasses.
 *
 * Interestingly, you can easily compare the performance cost of the GL drawing
 * activity, relative to the overhead of the cocos3d framework. To do so, uncomment
 * the first line in the implementation of the initializeScene method of this class.
 * See the inline comments above that first line within the initializeScene method
 * to understand how this works.
