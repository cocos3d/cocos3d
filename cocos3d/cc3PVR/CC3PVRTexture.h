/** 
 * The representation of a PVR texture that has been loaded into the GL engine.
 *
 * This class is used for all 2D and cube-map textures loaded from a PVR file type.
 *
 * This class is part of a class-cluster under the parent CC3Texture class. Although you can
 * invoke an instance creation method on this class directly, you will more commonly invoke
 * them on the CC3Texture class instead. The creation and initialization methods will ensure
 * that the correct subclass for the texture type, and in some cases, the texture file type,
 * is created and returned. Because of this class-cluster structure, be aware that the class
 * of the instance returned by an instance creation or initialization method may be different
 * than the receiver of that method.
