/**
 * Instantiates an instance of CC3PODResourceNode, loads it from the POD file at
 * the specified path, and adds the CC3PODResourceNode instance as a child node
 * to this CC3Scene instance.
 *
 * The specified file path may be either an absolute path, or a path relative to the
 * application resource directory. If the file is located directly in the application
 * resources directory, the specified file path can simply be the name of the file.
 * 
 * The name of the resource node will be that of the file.
 *
 * If this method is being invoked from a background thread (ie- not the main rendering thread)
 * AND this node is already part of a scene, this operation will automatically be deferred and
 * queued onto the main operation queue, to be performed on teh main rendering thread prior to
 * the next rendeirng cycle. This is to ensure that the node is not added while the scene is
 * being rendered, to avoid race conditions.
 *
 * In this situation, subsequent code executed on the background thread should not rely on the
 * specified node, or any of its descendants, having been added to the receiver or the scene.
 * For example, invoking this method on the background thread, followed by getNodeNamed: to the
 * receiver (or any of its ancestors), will almost certainly return nil, because this method
 * will have been deferred to the main thread, and will, almost certainly, not have been run by
 * the time the subsequent getNodeNamed: method is run on the background thread.
