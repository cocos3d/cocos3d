 * device orientation changes, and to permit this layer to be overlaid on the device camera if it
 * exists, permitting "augmented reality" displays
 *
 * This layer is a subclass of CCLayerColor, but may be initialized to behave as either a CCLayerColor
 * or a basic CCLayer, respectively, by using the initWithColor:width:height: method to create a
 * backdrop color and blend, or the basic init method to initialize without a backdrop color or blend.
 *
 * Since layers generally cover the whole screen, the initial value of the alignContentSizeWithDeviceOrientation
 * property is YES, indicating that, by default, this layer will rotate its contentSize as the device orientation
 * changes between portrait and landscape.
 *
 * When overlaying the device camera, this layer will use a transparent GL clear color and will not
 * draw any backdrop color blend. When not overlaying the device camera, this layer will use opaque
 * black as the GL clear color, and will draw a backdrop color blend if it has been configured with one.
