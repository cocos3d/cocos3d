/**
 * CC3Fog controls fog in the 3D scene.
 *
 * Fog color is controlled by the floatColor property, or via support for the CCRGBAProtocol
 * protocol. However, be aware that alpha channels and opacity info are ignored by the OpenGL
 * implementation of fog effects. See the notes of the color property for more info.
 *
 * The style of attenuation imposed by the fog is set by the attenuationMode property.
 * See the notes of that property for information about how fog attenuates visibility.
 *
 * Using the performanceHint property, you can direct the GL engine to trade off between
 * faster or nicer rendering quality.
