/**
 * CC3Layer is a cocos2d CCLayer that supports full 3D rendering in combination with normal
 * cocos2d 2D rendering. It forms the bridge between the 2D and 3D drawing environments.
 *
 * The CC3Layer contains an instance of CC3Scene, and delegates all 3D operations, for both
 * updating and drawing 3D models, to the CC3Scene instance.
 *
 * In addition, like any cocos2d CCLayer, 2D child CCNodes can be added to this layer and
 * will be rendered either over or under the 3D scene, based on their individual Z-order.
 * In particular, 2D controls such as menus, sprites, labels, health bars, joysticks, etc,
 * can be overlayed on the 3D scene simply by adding them as children of this layer.
 * Similarly, a 2D backdrop could be rendered behind the 3D scene by adding an appropriate
 * CCNode as a child with a negative Z-order.
 *
 * Like other CCNodes, this layer can be added to another 2D node, and given a contentSize,
 * position, and scale. You can even dynamically move and scale the embedded CC3Layer
 * using CCActions.
 *
 * Changes to the position and scale of the CC3Layer are propagated to the viewport of the
 * contained CC3Scene, and to any child CC3Layers and CC3Scenes.
 *
 * However, these properties will only be propagated if the node being moved is a CC3Layer.
 * If the CC3Layer is a child of a regular 2D CCLayer or CCNode, and that node is moved,
 * the resulting changes to the position or scale of the child CC3Layer may not
 * automatically be propagated to the CC3Scene viewport. In this case, you can use the
 * updateViewport method of CC3Layer to ensure that the CC3Scene viewport is aligned
 * with the position and scale of the CC3Layer.
 *
 * Also, although the 3D scene will be correctly rendered when this, or a parent layer is
 * scaled, be aware that scaling of the 2D nodes affects the interaction between the 2D and
 * 3D environments. Specifically, when the 2D layer is scaled, the following limitation apply:
 *   - a 2D CCNode held by CC3Billboards whose shouldDrawAs2DOverlay property is set to
 *     YES, indicating that the 2D CCNode should be drawn as an overlay above the 3D
 *     scene, will not be rendered in the correct position, relative to the 3D scene.
 *   - projection and unprojection between the 2D and 3D coordinate systems, including
 *     projecting touch events onto 3D nodes, will not work correctly.
 *
 * CC3Layer descends from CCLayerColor, and will draw a colored background behind both 2D
 * and 3D content if configured with a background color.
 *
 * To make use of the standard cocos2d model updatating functionality to update and animate
 * the 3D scene, use the scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: methods of CC3Layer to invoke
 * periodic callbacks to the update: method of the CC3Layer instance. The update: method
 * forwards these callbacks to the CC3Scene instance held by the CC3Layer.
 *
 * To enable simple single-touch event handling for this layer, set the isTouchEnabled
 * property to YES. Once enabled, single-touch events will automatically be forwarded to
 * the touchEvent:at: method on your customized CC3Scene instance to support user selection
 * of 3D nodes via touches. For more information on handling 3D node selections, see the
 * description of the method nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: of CC3Scene.
 *
 * Since the touch-move events are both voluminous and seldom used, the implementation
 * of ccTouchMoved:withEvent: has been left out of the default CC3Layer implementation.
 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your customized
 * CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * For more sophisticated touch interfaces, such as multi-touch events or gestures, add
 * event-handing behaviour to your customized CC3Layer, as you would for any cocos2d
 * application and, when required, invoke the touchEvent:at: method on your customized
 * CC3Scene to initiate node selection.
 *
 * Most 3D games will be displayed in full-screen mode, so typically your custom CC3Layer
 * will be sized to cover the entire screen. However, the CC3Layer can indeed be set to a
 * contentSize less that the full window size, and may be positioned on the window, or
 * within a parent CCLayer like any other CCNode.
 * 
 * You can even dyanamically move your CC3Layer around within the window, by changing the
 * position property (for example, by using a CCMoveTo action).
 *
 * CC3Layer directly descends from CC3ControllableLayer, which means that it can optionally
 * be controlled by a CC3UIViewController instance. Doing so enables two features:
 *   - Automatic rotatation the layer (both the 2D and 3D components) when the device orientation changes.
 *   - The CC3Layer can be overlaid on a device camera image stream so that both the 2D and 3D scenes can
 *     participate in an augmented reality view perspective.
 *
 * With the CC3UIViewController attached, either or both of these features can be turned on
 * or off. If neither of these features is required, there is no need to instantiate and
 * attach a CC3UIViewController, and the CC3Layer can be used without it.
 *
 * For most applications, you will create subclasses of both CC3Layer and CC3Scene.
 * The customized subclass of CC3Scene manages the behaviour of the 3D resources.
 * The customized subclass of CC3Layer manages the 2D artifacts, such as menus, sprites,
 * labels, health bars, joysticks, etc, that you want to overlay on the 3D scene.
 *
 * Typically, you will create a separate instance of CC3Scene for each 3D scene. You can
 * also create a distinct CC3Layer for each scene as well or, more typically, reuse a single
 * CC3Layer instance across multiple CC3Scene scenes by simply assigning a differnt CC3Scene
 * instance to the layer. Any running actions in the old scene are automatically paused,
 * and any running actions in the new scene are automatically started. For more information
 * on swapping 3D scenes, see the notes on the cc3Scene property.
 * 
 * To create and use your CC3Layer and CC3Scene pair, follow these steps:
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3Scene class, including creating or loading 3D file resources
 *      in the initializeScene method.
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3Layer subclass, adding any 2D controls in the initializeControls
 *      method, and managing event handlers and gesture recognizers in the onOpenCC3Layer
 *      and onCloseCC3Layer methods.
 *   -# Attach your CC3Scene to the cc3Scene property of your CC3Layer.
 *   -# Invoke the play method of your CC3Scene to enable dynamic behaviour for the 3D scene.
 *   -# Schedule regular updates in your CC3Layer instance by invoking either the
 *      scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: method.
 *   -# Create a CC3UIViewController and run your CC3Layer instance by invoking the runSceneOnNode: method.
