 * the contained nodes by their Z-order, which is a combination of the explicit
 * Z-order property of each node, and a measure of the distance from the camera
 * to the globalCenterOfGravity of the node's bounding volume.
 *
 * Use this sequencer for translucent nodes. There is no need to use this sequencer
 * for nodes that are opaque (whose isOpaque property returns YES), and the overhead
 * of testing each node on each update should be avoided in that case.
 *
 * The nodes are sorted using the Z-order property and the cameraDistanceProduct
 * property of the boundingVolume of each node, from furthest from the camera to
 * closest. Nodes without a boundingVolume are added to the end of the array.
 *
 * Explicit Z-order sequence takes priority over distance to camera. However,
 * sorting based on distance to the camera alone is quite effective. In almost all
 * cases, it is not necessary to set the Z-order property of the nodes, and if the
 * nodes are moving around, assigning an explicit Z-order to each node can actually
 * interfere with the dynamic determination of the correct drawing order. Only use
 * the Z-order property if you have reason to force a specific node to be drawn
 * before or after another node for visual effect.
 *
 * The distance between a node and the camera can be measured in one of two ways:
 *   -# The true 3D straight-line distance between the node and the camera.
 *   -# The distance from the camera to the node measured "straight out" from the
 *      camera, ignoring how far the node is away from the center of the camera's view.
 *
 * The value of the shouldUseOnlyForwardDistance property determines which of these two
 * methods will be used. See the notes of that property in the CC3NodeSequencer for more
 * information. By default, the true 3D distance is used.
 *
 * Since all nodes, and the camera, can move around on each update, this sequencer will
 * test and re-order its nodes on each update.
 *
 * Be careful about setting the allowSequenceUpdates property to NO on this sequencer.
 * Since this sequencer will generally only be used to keep translucent nodes in their
 * correct drawing order, setting allowSequenceUpdates to NO will defeat the purpose,
 * and will result in translucent nodes not properly displaying other translucent
 * objects that are behind them.
