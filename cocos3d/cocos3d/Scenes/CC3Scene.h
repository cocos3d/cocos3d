/**
 * CC3Scene is a CC3Node that manages a 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3Scene has the following responsibilities:
 *   - Acts as the root of the CC3Node structural assembly for the scene
 *   - Manages updating scene activity, including nodes, lights, and the camera
 *     based on a periodic animation trigger from the CC3Layer
 *   - Manages the drawing of the 3D artifacts to the GL engine
 *   - Manages the transition from 2D to 3D behaviour during each drawing frame
 *   - Manages the ordering of drawing of the 3D objects to maximize performance
 *   - facilitates user interaction with the scene by interacting with UI events
 *     occuring in the CC3Layer controls
 *   - supports selection of 3D nodes via UI touch events
 *   - collects performance statistics
 *
 * When creating a 3D application, you will almost always create a subclass of
 * CC3Scene to define the control, features, and behaviour of your 3D scene suitable
 * to your application. In your CC3Scene subclass, your will typically override one
 * or more of the following template methods:
 *
 *   - initializeScene - assemble the objects in your 3D scene, or load them from files.
 *
 *   - updateBeforeTransform: - periodically update the activity of your 3D scene prior to
 *                              the automatic recalulation of the node's transformation
 *                              matrix, and prior to the automatic invoking the same method
 *                              on each of child node of this node.
 *
 *   - updateAfterTransform:  - periodically update the activity of your 3D scene after
 *                              the automatic recalulation of the node's transformMatrix
 *                              and prior to the automatic invoking the same method on each
 *                              of child node of this node.
 *
 *   - onOpen  - invoked automatically when the layer that is holding this scene is first
 *               opened for viewing, or when this scene is assigned to a layer that is already
 *               open. The application can override this method to perform any initialization
 *               that requires the camera frustum, or initial transforms or global properties
 *               (eg- globalLocation) of any nodes.
 *
 *   - onClose - invoked automatically when the layer is removed from viewing, or when this
 *               scene is removed from the layer (as during scene swapping). The application
 *               can override this method to perform any activities associated with removing
 *               the layer and this scene from the view. For example, the application may use
 *               this opportunity to release any memory resources that are no longer needed.
 * 
 * In these methods, you can manipulate most nodes by setting their properties.
 * You can move and orient nodes using the node's location, rotation and scale
 * properties, and can show or hide nodes with the node's visible property.
 *
 * You should override the updateBeforeTransform: method if you need to make changes to
 * the transform properties (location, rotation, scale), of any node. These changes will
 * them automatically be applied to the transformMatrix of the node and its child nodes.
 *
 * You should override the updateAfterTransform: method if you need access to the
 * global transform properties (globalLocation, globalRotation, globalScale), of a node
 * since these properties are only valid after the transformMatrix has been recalculated.
 * An example of where access to the global transform properties would be useful is in
 * the execution of collision detection algorithms.
 *
 * To access nodes in your scene, you can use the method getNodeNamed: on the CC3Scene
 * (or any node). However, if you need to access the same node repeatedly, for example
 * to update it on every frame, it's highly recommended that you retrieve it once and
 * then cache it in an instance variable in your CC3Scene instance.
 *
 * By default, the initializeScene, updateBeforeTransform:, and updateAfterTransform:
 * methods do nothing. Subclasses do not need to invoke this default superclass
 * implementations in the overridden methods. The updateBeforeTransform: and
 * updateAfterTransform: methods are defined in the CC3Node class.
 * See the documentation there.
 *
 * If you change the contents of the scene outside of the normal update mechanism,
 * for instance, as a result of a user event, you may find that the next frame is
 * rendered without the updated content. Depending on the degree of change to your
 * scene (for instance, if you have removed and added many nodes), you may notice a
 * flicker. To avoid this, you can use the updateScene method to force your updates
 * to be processed immediately, without waiting for the next update interval.
 *
 * You must add at least one CC3Camera to your 3D scene to make it viewable. This
 * camera may be added directly, or it may be added as part of a larger node assembly.
 * Regardless of the technique used to add cameras, the CC3Scene will take the first
 * camera added and automatically make it the activeCamera.
 *
 * The camera can also be used to project global locations within the 3D scene onto
 * a 2D point on the screen view, and can be used to project 2D screen points onto
 * a ray or plane intersection within the 3D scene. See the class notes of  CC3Camera
 * for more information on mapping between 3D and 2D locations.
 *
 * You can add fog to your scene using the fog property. Fog has a color and blends
 * with the display of objects within the scene. Objects farther away from the camera
 * are affected by the fog more than objects that are closer to the camera.
 *
 * During drawing, the nodes can be traversed in the hierarchical order of the
 * node structural assembly, starting at the CC3Scene instance that forms the root node
 * of the node assembly. Alternately, and preferrably, the CC3Scene can use a
 * CC3NodeSequencer instance to arrange the nodes into a linear sequence, ordered and
 * grouped based on definable sorting priorities. This is beneficial, because it allows
 * the application to order and group drawing operations in ways that reduce the number
 * and scope of state changes within the GL engine, thereby improving performance and
 * throughput.
 * 
 * For example, when drawing, nodes could be grouped by the drawing sequencer so that
 * opaque objects are drawn prior to blended objects, and an application with many
 * objects that use the same material or mesh can be sorted so that nodes with like
 * materials or meshes are grouped together. It is highly recommended that you use a
 * CC3NodeSequencer, and this is the default configuration for CC3Scene instances.
 *
 * The CC3Scene maintains this drawing sequence separately from the hierarchical node
 * assembly. This allows the maintenance of the hierarchical parent-child relationships
 * for operations such as movement and transformations, while simultaneously enabling
 * more efficient drawing operations through node drawing sequencing.
 *
 * An instance of CC3Scene is held by an instance of CC3Layer, which is a subclass of
 * the cocos2d CCLayer class, and can participate with other cocos2d layers and CCNodes
 * in an overall cocos2d scene. During drawing, the CC3Layer delegates all 3D operations
 * to its CC3Scene instance. You will also typically create a subclass of CC3Layer that
 * is customized for your application. In most cases, you will add methods and state to
 * both your CC3Scene and CC3Layer subclasses to facilitate user interaction.
 * 
 * The CC3Layer and CC3Scene can process touch events. To enable touch event handling,
 * set the isTouchEnabled property of your customized CC3Layer to YES. Touch events are
 * forwarded from the CC3Layer to the touchEvent:at: method of your CC3Scene for handling
 * by your CC3Scene.
 *
 * Since the touch-move events are both voluminous and seldom used, the implementation
 * of ccTouchMoved:withEvent: has been left out of the default CC3Layer implementation.
 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your customized
 * CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * The default implementation of the touchEvent:at: method forwards all touch events to
 * the node picker held in the touchedNodePicker property. The node picker determines
 * which 3D node is under the touch point. Object picking is handled asynchronously, and
 * once the node is retrieved, the nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: callback method will be
 * invoked on your customized CC3Scene instance. You indicate which nodes in your scene
 * should respond to touch events by setting the isTouchEnabled property on those nodes
 * that you want to trigger a touch event callback to the nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at:
 * method. See the description of the nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: method and the
 * CC3Node isTouchEnabled property for useful hints about choosing which nodes to enable
 * for touch selection.
 *
 * Be aware that node picking from touch events is expensive, and you should override
 * the touchEvent:at: method to forward to the node picker only those touch events that
 * you actually intend to select a node. By default, all touch events are forwarded from
 * the touchEvent:at: method. You should override this implementation, handle touch events
 * that are not used for selection directly in this method, and forward only those events
 * for which you want a node picked, to the touchedNodePicker.
 *
 * The node picker uses a colorization algorithm to determine which node is under the
 * touch point. When a touch event occurs and has been forwarded to the node picker,
 * the node picker draws the scene in solid colors, with each node a different color,
 * and then reads the color of the pixel under the touch point to identify the object
 * under the touch point. This is performed under the covers, and the scene is immediately
 * redrawn in true colors and textures before being presented to the screen, so the user
 * is never aware that the scene was drawn twice. However, be aware that, if a translucent
 * or transparent object has nothing but the CC3Layer background color behind it, AND that
 * CC3Layer background color is also translucent or transparent, you might notice an
 * unavoidable flicker of the translucent node. To avoid this, you can use a backdrop or
 * skybox in your 3D scene. This issue only occurs during node picking, and only when
 * BOTH the node and the CC3Layer background colors are translucent or transparent, and
 * the backgound color is directly behind the node.
 *
 * Depending on the complexity of the application, it may instantiate a single CC3Scene,
 * instance, or multiple instances if the application progresses from scene to scene.
 * Similarly, the application may have a single CC3Layer, or multiple CC3Layers.
 * Each CC3Layer may have its own CC3Scene instance, or may share a single instance.
 *
 * To maximize GL throughput, all OpenGL ES 1.1 state is tracked by the singleton instance
 * [CC3OpenGLESEngine engine]. CC3OpenGLESEngine only sends state change calls to the
 * GL engine if GL state really is changing. It is critical that all changes to GL state
 * are made through the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton. When adding or overriding functionality
 * in this framework, do NOT make gl* function calls directly if there is a corresponding
 * state change tracker in the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton. Route the state change request
 * through the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton instead.
 *
 * You can collect statistics about the performance of your cocos3d application by setting
 * the performanceStatistics property to an appropriate instance of a statistics collector.
 * By default, no statistics are collected. See the notes of the performanceStatistics
 * property for more information.

 *
 * The touchType is one of the enumerated touch types: kCCTouchBegan, kCCTouchMoved,

 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your
 * customized CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * This default implementation forwards touch-down events to the pickNodeFromTouchEvent:at:
 * method, which determines which 3D node is under the touch point, and does nothing with

 *

 * events to this method. You can also override this method to enhance the touch
 * interaction, such as swipe detection, or dragging & dropping objects. You can use
 * the implementation of this method as a template for enhancements.
 *
 * Node selection from tap events can also be handled by using the unprojectPoint:

/**
 * A CC3TouchedNodePicker instance handles picking nodes from touch events in a CC3Scene.
 * 
 * This handler maintains a queue of touch types, to ensure than none are missed. However,
 * it does not keep a queue of touch points. Instead, it uses the most recent touch point
 * to determine the 3D object under the touch point.
 *
 * This handler picks 3D nodes using a color picking algorithm. When a touch event occurs,
 * its type is added to the queue, and the touch position is updated. On the next rendering
 * pass, the 3D scene is rendered so that each 3D node has a unique color. The color of
 * the pixel under the touch point then identifies the node that was touched. The scene
 * is then re-rendered in true colors in the same rendering pass, so the user never sees
 * the unique-color rendering that was used to pick the node.
 *
 * Once the node is picked, it is cached. On the next update pass, the node is picked up
 * and all touch events that occured since the previous update pass are dispatched to the
 * CC3Scene in sequence.
 *
 * This asychronous design keeps the update and rendering loops from interfering with each
 * other. The rendering loop only has to pick the object that is under the touch point
 * that was most recently recorded. And if the dispatching of events takes time, only the
 * update loop will be affected. The rendering loop can continue unhindered.
 *
 * For rapid finger movements, it is quite likely that more than one touch event could 
 * arrive before the next rendering pass picks a 3D node. For this reason, no attempt is
 * made to find the node for each and every touch location. In addition, the touch type
 * is only added to the queue if it is different than the previous touch type. For example,
 * a rapid inflow of kCCTouchMoved events will only result in a single kCCTouchMoved event
 * being picked and dispatched to the CC3Scene on each pair of  rendering and updating passes.
