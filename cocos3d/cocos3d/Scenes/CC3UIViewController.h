 *
 * The initial value is one. You can set this property prior to referencing the view property of this
 * controller in order to have the view created with a different number of samples per pixel. Setting
 * this value to a number larger than one will smooth out the lines and edges of your displayed models.
 *
 * The value set will be clamped to the maximum allowable value for the platform. That maximum value
 * can be retrieved from CC3OpenGLESEngine.engine.platform.maxPixelSamples.value, and generally has
 * a value of four on all current devices that support multisampling.
 *
 * Retrieving the value of the CC3OpenGLESEngine.engine.platform.maxPixelSamples.value property can
 * only be done once the OpenGL ES context has been established, which is generally performed when the
 * view is created. This creates a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation where you might need the maximum
 * pixel samples value before you create the view, but can't retrieve it until the view has been created.
 * This particular value does not vary much from device to device, so the work-around is to determine
 * the maximum value at development time, and then select a pixel samples value accordingly.
 *
 * Setting the value of this property to zero is the same as setting it to one, and either value will
 * effectively turn multisampling off.
 *

 * Multisampling is currently incompatible with using the stencil buffer. If the viewShouldUseStencilBuffer
 * property returns YES, the value of this property cannot be set higher than one .

 * to change both the running scene, and this controlledNode property together, instead of setting
 * this property directly. If in doubt, use the runSceneOnNode: method instead of this property.

/**
 * This is a convenience method designed to change the displayed cocos2d scene, and keep the CCNode
 * being controlled by this controller (typically an instance of CCLayer) synchronized with the scene
 * being run by the shared CCDirector.
 *
 * This method sets the controlledNode property of this controller to the specified node, wraps the
 * specified node in a CCScene (if it is not already a CCScene), and runs the new scene by invoking
 * either replaceScene: or runWithScene: on the shared CCDirector, depending on whether the director
 * is already running a scene.
 *
 * This method can be invoked either before or after the view associated with this controller has
 * been added to the view hierarchy. If after, the transition to the CCScene corresponding to the
 * specified CCNode will occur immediately. However, if this method is invoked before the view has
 * been added to the view hierarchy, this method has the same effect as setting the controlledNode
 * property directly, and the running of the CCScene corresponding to the specified CCNode will be
 * deferred until the view is added to the view hierarchy, at which point it will be run automatically.
 * This ensures that the view is in place, and the CCScene can derive its corresponding size before
 * an attempt is made to run that CCScene.
 *
 * Consequently, during app startup, when the view has not been loaded and the CCDirector does not
 * yet have a running scene, you can set the controlledNode property directly instead of invoking
 * this method. But once a scene is running, you should use this method to both change the scene,
 * and change the controlledNode property together. When in doubt, use this method instead of
 * setting the controlledNode property directly.

 * This property can only be set to YES if a camera is actually available on the device.
 *
 * If the device supports a camera, setting this property to YES will cause the controller to immediately
 * open a view of the device camera and overlay the CCNode view on top of the device camera view.
 *
 * Setting this property to NO will cause the controller to close the device camera
 * (if it was open) and display the CCNode without the camera background.
 *
 * This property should only be set once the view has been added to the window and the window
 * has been keyed and made visible.
 *
 * Displaying the scene overlaying the device camera requires the underlying UIView to combine the two
 * graphic scenes. This is not without a performance cost, and you should expect to see a drop in animation
 * frame rate as a result. Typically, the frame rate while overlaying the camera (more precisely, while the
 * underlying UIView has a clear background color) will typically be capped at about 40 fps.

 *   - If the CCNode is currently running, it is sent an onExit message to cause it to
 *     stop running, clean up any active actions, and reset its touch event handling.

 *
 *   - This controller is sent a willChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.

 *   - The isOverlayingDeviceCamera property of this controller is changed.
 *
 *   - If the isOverlayingDeviceCamera property is being set to YES, the picker
 *     UIImagePickerController is presented modally. If the isOverlayingDeviceCamera
 *     property is being set to NO, the modal picker UIImagePickerController is dismissed.
 *
 *   - This controller is sent a didChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.
 *
 *   - If the CCNode was running, it is sent an onEnter message to cause it to restart,
 *     be ready for actions, and, in the case of CCLayers, re-register for touch events.
 *     CCNode subclasses can also override onEnter to perform other activities associated
