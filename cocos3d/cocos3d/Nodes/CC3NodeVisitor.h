 * into a CC3Ray that projects into the 3D scene from the center of the camera. All objects
 * that lie visually below the touch point will be punctured by that projected ray.
 *

 * the path of a bullet.
 * 
 * To find the nodes that are punctured by a global CC3Ray, create an instance of this class,
 * and invoke the visit: method on that instance, passing the CC3Scene as the argument. You can
 * also invoke the visit: method with a particular structural node, instead of the full CC3Scene,
 * to limit the range of nodes to inspect (for example, to determine which object in a room, but
