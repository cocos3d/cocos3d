 * also invoke the visit: method with a particular structural node, instead of the full CC3Scene,
 * to limit the range of nodes to inspect (for example, to determine which object in a room, but
 * not outside the room, was hit by a bullet), for design or performance reasons.
 *
 * The visitor will collect the nodes that are punctured by the ray, in order of distance from
 * the startLocation of the CC3Ray. You can access the nodes and the puncture locations using the
 * closestPuncturedNode, punctureNodeAt: closestPunctureLocation, and punctureLocationAt: methods.
 *
 * Only nodes that have a bounding volume will be tested by this visitor. Nodes without a bounding
 * volume, or whose shouldIgnoreRayIntersection property is set to YES will be ignored by this visitor.
 *
 * The shouldPunctureFromInside property can be used to include or exclude nodes where the start
 * location of the ray is within its bounding volume. 
 *
 * To save instantiating a CC3NodePuncturingVisitor each time, you can reuse the visitor instance
 * over and over, through different invocations of the visit: method.
