#pragma mark Populating parametric triangles

/**
 * Populates this instance as a simple triangular mesh.
 *
 * The specified face defines the three vertices at the corners of the triangular mesh in 3D space.
 * The vertices within the CC3Face structure are specified in the winding order of the triangular
 * face. The winding order of the specified face determines the winding order of the vertices in
 * the mesh, and the direction of the normal vector applied to each of the vertices. Since the
 * resulting triangular mesh is flat, all vertices will have the same normal vector.
 
 * Although the triangle can be created with the corners can be anywhere in 3D space, for
 * simplicity of construction, it is common practice, when using this method, to specify the
 * mesh in the X-Y plane (where all three corners have a zero Z-component), and then rotate
 * this node to an orientation in 3D space.
 *
 * The texCoords parameter is an array of ccTex2F structures, providing the texture coordinates for
 * the cooresponding vertices of the face. This array must have three elements, one for each vertex
 * in the specified face. If the mesh will not be covered with a texture, you can pass in any values
 * in the elements of this array.
 *
 * The tessellation property determines how the mesh will be tessellated into smaller faces. The
 * specified tessellation value indicates how many divisions each side of the main triangle should
 * be divided into. Each side of the triangular mesh is tessellated into the same number of divisions.
 *
 * This mesh can be covered with a solid material or a single texture. If this mesh is to be covered
 * with a texture, use the texture property of this mesh to set the texture. If a solid color is
 * desired, leave the texture property unassigned.
 *
 * The vertexContentType property of this mesh may be set prior to invoking this method, to define the
 * content type for each vertex. Content types kCC3VertexContentLocation, kCC3VertexContentNormal, and
 * kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate are populated by this method.
 *
 * If the vertexContentType property has not already been set, that property is set to a value of
 * (kCC3VertexContentLocation | kCC3VertexContentNormal | kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate), and
 * the mesh will be populated with location, normal and texture coordinates for each vertex.

 * The surface of the disk is divided into many smaller divisions, both in the radial and

 *
 * The radialAndAngleDivs argument indicates how to divide the surface of the disks into

 * that the mesh will consist of a series of radial triangles from the center of the

 * will structure the mesh as a series of concentric rings. This value must be at least one.
 * 
 * The Y element of the radialAndAngleDivs argument indicates how many angular divisions
 * will occur around the circumference. This value must be at least three, which will
 * essentially render the circle as a triangle. But, typically, this value will be larger.
 * 
 * For example, a value of {4,24} for the radialAndAngleDivs argument will result in the
 * disk being divided into four concentric rings, each divided into 24 segments around the
 * circumference of the circle.
 * 
 * Each segement, except those in the innermost disk is trapezoidal, and will be constructed

 *
 * The "front" of the box is the side that faces towards the positive-Z axis, the "top"
 * of the box is the side that faces towards the positive-Y axis, and the "right" side
 * of the box is the side that faces towards the positive-X axis.
 *
 * For the purposes of wrapping a texture around the box, the texture will wrap
 * uniformly around all sides, and the texture will not appear stretched between any
 * two adjacent sides. This is useful when you are texturing the box with a simple
 * rectangular repeating pattern and want the texture to appear consistent across
 * the sides, for example, a brick pattern wrapping around all four sides of a house.
 *
 * Depending on the relative aspect of the height and width of the box, the texture
 * may appear distorted horizontal or vertically. If you need to correct that, you
 * can use the repeatTexture: method, and adjust one of the dimensions.
 *
 * For higher fidelity in applying textures to non-cube boxes, so that the texture
 * will not be stretched to fit, use the populateAsSolidBox:withCorner: method.

 *
 * For the purposes of wrapping the texture around the box, the corner argument
 * specifies the relative point in the texture that will map to the corner of the
 * box that is at the juncture of the "left", "front" and "bottom" sides (see the
 * BoxTexture.png image for a better understanding of this point). The corner
 * argument is specified as a fraction in each of the S & T dimensions of the texture.
 * In the CGPoint that specifies the corner, the x & y elements of the CGPoint
 * correspond to the S & T dimensions of this left-front-bottom corner mapping,
 * with each value being between zero and one.
 *
 * Since, by definition, opposite sides of the box have the same dimensions, this
 * single corner point identifies the S & T dimensions of all six of the sides of
 * the box. A value of (1/4, 1/3) for the corner is used when the box is a cube.
 * A smaller value for the x-element would move the corner to the left in the
 * texture layout, indicating that the left and right sides are shallower than
 * they are in a cube, and that the front and back are wider than in a cube, and
 * vice-versa for a larger value in the x-element of the corner. Similarly for
 * the y-element. A y-element that is smaller than 1/3, moves the corner point
 * downwards on the texture, indicating that the bottom and top are shallower than
 * they are in a cube, or that the front and back are higher than they are in a cube.
 *
 * The two axes defined by the corner are interrelated, because the sides need to
 * be the same depth as the top and bottom. The best way to determine the values to
 * use in the corner is to use the measure of this point (where the "left", "front",
 * and "bottom" sides meet) from the layout of the texture. If the aspect of the

#pragma mark Populating for bitmapped font textures

/**
 * Populates this instance as a rectangular mesh displaying the text of the specified string,
 * built from bitmap character images taken from a texture atlas as defined by the bitmpped font
 * configuration loaded from the specified font configuration file.
 *
 * A compatible bitmap font configuration file, and associated texture, can be created using any
 * of these editors:
 *    http://glyphdesigner.71squared.com/ (Commercial, Mac OS X)
 *    http://www.bmglyph.com/ (Commercial, Mac OS X - also available through AppStore)
 *    http://www.n4te.com/hiero/hiero.jnlp (Free, Java)
 *    http://slick.cokeandcode.com/demos/hiero.jnlp (Free, Java)
 *    http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ (Free, Windows only)
 *
 * The texture that matches the specified font configuration (and identified in the font configuration),
 * is automatically loaded and assigned to the texture property of this mesh node.
 *
 * The text may be multi-line, and can be left-, center- or right-aligned, as specified.
 *
 * The specified lineHeight define the height of a line of text in the coordinate system of this
 * mesh node. This parameter can be set to zero to use the natural line height of the font.
 *
 * For example, a font with font size of 16 might have a natural line height of 19. Setting the
 * lineHeight parameter to zero would result in a mesh where a line of text would be 19 units high.
 * On the other hand, setting this property to 0.2 will result in a mesh where the same line of text
 * has a height of 0.2 units. Depending on the size of other models in your scene, you may want to
 * set this lineHeight to something compatible. In addition, the visual size of the text will also
 * be affected by the value of the scale or uniformScale properties of this node. Both the lineHeight
 * and scale properties work to establish the visual size of the label text.
 *
 * For a more granular mesh, each character rectangle can be divided into many smaller divisions.
 * Building a rectanglular surface from more than one division can dramatically improve realism
 * when the surface is illuminated with specular lighting or a tightly focused spotlight, or if
 * the mesh is to be deformed in some way by a later process (such as wrapping the text texture
 * around some other shape).
 *
 * The divsPerChar argument indicates how to break each character rectangle into multiple faces.
 * The X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument indicate how each axis if the rectangle for each
 * character should be divided into faces. The number of faces in the rectangle for each character
 * will therefore be the multiplicative product of the X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument.
 *
 * For example, a value of {3,2} for the divsPerChar argument will result in each character being
 * divided into 6 smaller rectangular faces, arranged into a 3x2 grid.
 *
 * The relative origin defines the location of the origin for texture alignment, and is specified
 * as a fraction of the size of the overall label layout, starting from the bottom-left corner.
 *
 * For example, origin values of (0, 0), (0.5, 0.5), and (1, 1) indicate that the label mesh should
 * be aligned so that the bottom-left corner, center, or top-right corner, respectively, should be
 * located at the local origin of the corresponding mesh.
 *
 * The vertexContentType property of this mesh may be set prior to invoking this method, to define the
 * content type for each vertex. Content types kCC3VertexContentLocation, kCC3VertexContentNormal, and
 * kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate are populated by this method.
 *
 * If the vertexContentType property has not already been set, that property is set to a value of
 * (kCC3VertexContentLocation | kCC3VertexContentNormal | kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate), and
 * the mesh will be populated with location, normal and texture coordinates for each vertex.
 *
 * This method may be invoked repeatedly to change the label string. The mesh will automomatically
 * be rebuilt to the correct number of vertices required to display the currently specified string.
