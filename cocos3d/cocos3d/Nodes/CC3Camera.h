/**
 * CC3Camera represents the camera viewing the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3Camera is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the camera itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a camera can be mounted on a boom object or truck, and will move along with
 * the parent node. Or the camera node itself might have a light node attached as a child,
 * so that the light will move along with the camera, and point where the camera points.
 *
 * However, when adding a camera to an assembly of nodes, be aware of whether the parent nodes
 * use scaling. To construct the viewMatrix, the camera makes heavy use of matrix inversion of the
 * cummulative transform matrix of the camera's transforms and the transforms of all its ancestors.
 * If scaling has not been added to any ancestor nodes, the cummulative transform will be a Rigid
 * transform. Inverting a Rigid transform matrix is much, much faster (orders of magnitude) than
 * inverting a matrix that contains scaling and is therefore not rigid. If possible, try to avoid
 * applying scaling to the ancestor nodes of this camera.
 *
 * Like any CC3Node, CC3Camera can be pointed in a specific direction, pointed at a specific
 * location, or at a specific node by setting the forwardDirection, targetLocation, or target
 * properties, respectively.
 *
 * The camera can be configured for either perspective or parallel projection, using the
 * isUsingParallelProjection property. By default, the camera will use perspective projection.
 *
 * You can use the projectLocation: and projectNode: methods to project global locations within
 * the 3D scene into 2D view coordinates, indicating where on the screen a 3D object appears.
 *
 * You can use the unprojectPoint: and unprojectPoint:ontoPlane: methods to project a 2D screen
 * position into either a ray (a line) in the 3D scene, or into a specific intersection location
 * on a 3D plane.
 *
 * You can use the  moveToShowAllOf:... or moveWithDuration:toShowAllOf: family of methods to
 * have the camera automatically focus on, and display all of, a particular node, or even the
 * whole scene itself.
 *
 * Scaling a camera is a null operation because it scales everything, including the size of objects,
 * but also the distance from the camera to those objects. The effects cancel out, and visually it
 * appears that nothing has changed.
 *
 * Therefore, for cameras, the scale and uniformScale properties are not applied to the transform
 * matrix. Instead, the uniformScale property acts as a zoom factor (as if the camera lens is zoomed
 * in or out), and influences the fieldOfView property accordingly. See the description of the
 * fieldOfView property for more information about zooming.
 *
 * If you find that objects in the periphery of your view appear elongated, you can adjust
 * the fieldOfView and/or uniformScale properties to reduce this "fish-eye" effect.
 * See the notes of the fieldOfView property for more on this.
 *
 * For cameras, any change in the projection parameters, such as fieldOfView, scale, near or far
 * clipping distances, is considered a transform change, and the transformListeners are sent a
 * notification via the nodeWasTransformed: method when the projection matrix is recalculated.

/**
 * The nominal field of view of this camera, in degrees. The initial value of this
 * property is set to kCC3DefaultFieldOfView.
 *
 * The effect of setting this property is affected by the fieldOfViewOrientation,
 * fieldOfViewAspectOrientation, and  uniformScale properties.
 *
 * In handheld devices, the device orientation can change at will, changing the aspect ratio
 * of the camera viewport. The fieldOfViewOrientation, and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation
 * properties work together to establish and maintain a consistent perspective, regardless
 * of the current aspect ratio.
 *
 * The fieldOfViewOrientation property indicates whether this fieldOfView value is measured
 * horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the display surface. 
 *
 * The fieldOfViewAspectOrientation property indicates the orientation (portrait or landscape)
 * of the display surface to which this fieldOfView value is specified.
 *
 * The fieldOfViewOrientation and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation properties combine to
 * determine whether the fieldOfView value is measured horizontally or vertically, and
 * whether it was meant to be applied to the long or short side of the display surface.
 * 
 * Applying a field of view angle across the short side of the display surface will produce
 * a somewhat different view perspective than if the same field of view value is applied
 * across the long side of the display surface.
 *
 * Knowing these values, this camera can then automatically adjust the perspective, and keep
 * it consistent, regardless of the actual orientation of the device and display surface.
 *
 * For example, if the fieldOfViewOrientation property indicates that the fieldOfView applies
 * to the horizontal direction, and the fieldOfViewAspectOrientation indicates that the
 * horizontal side is longer than the vertical side (landscape), the camera knows that the
 * fieldOfView property should be applied to the long side, regardless of the orientation
 * of the device and display surface. 
 *
 * As another example, a vertical fieldOfViewOrientation, combined with a landscape
 * fieldOfViewAspectOrientation corresponds to the commonly-used Hor+ FOV technique.
 *
 * See the notes for the fieldOfViewOrientation and fieldOfViewAspectOrientation properties
 * for more information about how they affect the use of the fieldOfView.
 *
 * The effective field of view is influenced by the value of the uniformScale property,
 * which, for cameras, acts as a zoom factor (as if the camera lens is zoomed in or out).
 * The effective field of view of this camera is calculated as (fieldOfView / uniformScale).
 *
 * Once a nominal field of view has been set in this property, changing the scale or
 * uniformScale properties will change the effective field of view accordingly (although
 * the value of the fieldOfView property remains the same). Scales greater than one zoom in
 * (objects appear larger), and scales between one and zero zoom out (objects appear smaller).
 *
 * Like real-world cameras, larger values of the effective field of view can result in a
 * "fish-eye" effect, where objects at the periphery of the view can appear elongated.
 * To reduce this effect, lower the value of fieldOfView property, or increase the value
 * of the uniformScale property. In doing so, you may need to move your camera further
 * away from the scene, so that your view will continue to include the same objects.
 *
 * The effective field of view is clamped to keep it below 180 degrees, beyond which
 * the scene would vanish into the distance.

 *
 * The returned result is a 4D vector, where the x, y & z components give the intersection
 * location in 3D space, and the w component gives the distance from the camera to the
 * intersection location. If the w component is negative, the intersection point is behind
 * the camera, which is an indication that the camera is looking away from the plane.
 *
 * If the ray from the camera through the specified point is parallel to the plane, no
 * intersection occurs, and the returned 4D vector will be zeroed (equal to kCC3Vector4Zero).
 *
 * You should therefore test the w component value to make sure it is positive and
 * non-zero before proceeding with an activity such as dropping an object on the plane.
 * If the plane has bounds in your scene, you should also check whether the returned
 * intersection is within those bounds.

/**
 * Represents a camera's frustum. Each CC3Camera instance contains an instance of this class.
 *
 * Each frustum has four sides: top, bottom, left and right, and has two caps: near and far.
 * These sides and caps are represented as six planes.
 *
 * The frustum is a truncated pyramid that has the location of the camera as the pyrimid apex.
 * This frustum manages and populates the projection matrix used by the camera, and builds its
 * planes from a combination of that projection matrix and the camera's modelview matrix.
 *
 * The frustum is a type of bounding volume and therefore supports methods for testing whether
 * locations, rays, shapes, and other bounding volumes intersect the volume of the frustum.
