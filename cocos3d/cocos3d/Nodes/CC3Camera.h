/**
 * CC3Camera represents the camera viewing the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3Camera is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the camera itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a camera can be mounted on a boom object or truck, and will move along with
 * the parent node. Or the camera node itself might have a light node attached as a child,
 * so that the light will move along with the camera, and point where the camera points.
 *
 * However, when adding a camera to an assembly of nodes, be aware of whether the parent
 * nodes use scaling. To construct the viewMatrix, the camera makes heavy use of
 * matrix inversion of the cummulative transform matrix of the camera's transforms and
 * the transforms of all its ancestors. If scaling has not been added to any ancestor
 * nodes, the cummulative transform will be a Rigid transform. Inverting a Rigid transform
 * matrix is much, much faster (orders of magnitude) than inverting a matrix that contains
 * scaling and is therefore not rigid. If possible, try to avoid applying scaling to the
 * ancestor nodes of this camera.
 *
 * CC3Camera can be pointed in a particular direction, or can be made to track a target
 * node as that node moves, or the camera moves.
 *
 * The camera can be configured for either perspective or parallel projection, using
 * the isUsingParallelProjection property. By default, the camera will use perspective
 * projection.
 *
 * You can use the projectLocation: and projectNode: methods to project global locations
 * within the 3D scene into 2D view coordinates, indicating where on the screen a 3D
 * object appears.
 *
 * You can use the unprojectPoint: and unprojectPoint:ontoPlane: methods to project a
 * 2D screen position into either a ray (a line) in the 3D scene, or into a specific 
 * intersection location on a 3D plane.
 *
 * You can use the  moveToShowAllOf:... or moveWithDuration:toShowAllOf: family of
 * methods to have the camera automatically focus on, and display all of, a particular
 * node, or even the whole scene itself.
 *
 * Scaling a camera is a null operation because it scales everything, including the size
 * of objects, but also the distance from the camera to those objects. The effects cancel
 * out, and visually it appears that nothing has changed.
 *
 * Therefore, for cameras, the scale and uniformScale properties are not applied to the
 * transform matrix. Instead, the uniformScale property acts as a zoom factor (as if the
 * camera lens is zoomed in or out), and influences the fieldOfView property accordingly.
 * See the description of the fieldOfView property for more information about zooming.
 *
 * If you find that objects in the periphery of your view appear elongated, you can adjust
 * the fieldOfView and/or uniformScale properties to reduce this "fish-eye" effect.
 * See the notes of the fieldOfView property for more on this.
 *
 * For cameras, any change in the projection parameters, such as fieldOfView, scale,
 * near or far clipping distances, is considered a transform change, and the
 * transformListeners are sent a notification via the nodeWasTransformed: method
 * when the projection matrix is recalculated.
