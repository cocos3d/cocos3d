/**
 * CC3Node and its subclasses form the basis of all 3D artifacts in the 3D scene, including
 * visible meshes, structures, cameras, lights, resources, and the 3D scene itself.
 *
 * Nodes can be moved, rotated and scaled. Rotation can be specified via Euler angles,
 * quaternions, rotation axis and angle, or changes to any of these properties.
 *
 * In addition to programmatically rotating a node using the rotation quaternion, rotationAxis,
 * and rotationAngle properties, or one of the rotateBy...: methods, you can set a node to point
 * towards a particular direction, location. You can even point a node towards another target
 * node, and have it track that node, so that it always points towards the target node, as
 * either the node, or the target node move around.
 *
 * For more on targetting the node in a direction, or to track a target node, see the notes
 * of the following properties and methods:
 *   - target
 *   - targetLocation
 *   - shouldTrackTarget
 *   - targettingConstraint
 *   - shouldAutotargetCamera
 *   - isTrackingForBumpMapping
 *
 * Nodes can be assembled in a structural hierarchy of parents and children, using the addChild:
 * method. Transformations that are applied to a node are also applied to its descendant nodes.
 * Typically, the root of a structural node hierarchy is an instance of CC3Scene.
 *
 * When creating a structural hierarchy of nodes, it is often useful to wrap one node in another
 * node in order to orient the node of interest in a particular direction, or provide an offset
 * location in order to allow the node of interest to visually anchored at a location other than
 * its origin. To easily wrap a node in another node, use the following methods:
 *   - asOrientingWrapper
 *   - asTrackingWrapper
 *   - asCameraTrackingWrapper
 *   - asBumpMapLightTrackingWrapper
 *
 * Each node is automatically touched at two distinct times during animation frame handling.
 * First, the updateBeforeTransform: and updateAfterTransform: methods are each invoked during
 * scheduled model state updating, before and after the transformation matrix of the node is
 * rebuilt, respectively. You should override udpateBeforeTransform: method to make any changes
 * to the node, or its child nodes.
 * 
 * You should override updateAfterTransform: only if you need to make use of the global
 * properties of the node or its child nodes, such as globalLocation, globalRotation, or
 * globalScale. These properties are valid only after the transformMatrix has been
 * calculated, and are therefore not valid within the updateBeforeTransform: method.
 * However, if you make any changes to the transform properties (location, rotation, scale)
 * of a node within the updateAfterTransform: method, you must invoke the updateTransformMatrices
 * method on that node in order to have the changes applied to the node's transformMatrix.
 * 
 * Note that you do NOT need to invoke the updateTransformMatrices method for any changes
 * made in the updateBeforeTransform: method, since those changes will automatically be
 * applied to the transformMatrix.
 *
 * The second place a node is touched is the transformAndDrawWithVisitor: method,
 * which is automaticaly invoked during each frame rendering cycle. You should have
 * no need to override this method.
 * 
 * To maximize throughput, the operations of updating model state should be kept
 * separate from the operations of frame rendering, and the two should not be mixed.
 * Subclasses should respect this design pattern when overriding behaviour. Drawing
 * operations should not be included in state updating, and vice versa. Since OpenGL is
 * a hardware-accelerated state-machine pipeline, this separation allows frame-drawing
 * operations to be performed by the GPU at the same time that state update operations for
 * the next frame are being handled by the CPU, and on some systems, permits frame drawing
 * and model updating to be perfomed on separate threads.
 *
 * CC3Nodes support the cocos2d CCAction class hierarchy. Nodes can be translated, rotated,
 * and scaled in three dimensions, or made to point towards a direction (for cameras and
 * lights), all under control of cocos2d CCActions. As with other CCActions, these actions
 * can be combined into action sequences or repeating actions, or modified with cocos2d
 * ease actions. See the class CC3TransformTo and its subclasses for actions that operate
 * on CC3Nodes.
 *
 * When populating your scene, you can easily create hordes of similar nodes using the copy
 * and copyWithName: methods. Those methods effect deep copies to allow each copy to be
 * manipulated independently, but will share underlying mesh data for efficient memory use.
 * See the notes at the copy method for more details about copying nodes.
 *
 * You can animate this class with animation data held in a subclass of CC3NodeAnimation.
 * To animate this node using animation data, set the animation property to an instance of
 * a subclass of the abstract CC3NodeAnimation class, populated with animation data, and
 * then create an instance of a CC3Animate action, and run it on this node.
 *
 * Nodes can respond to iOS touch events. The property isTouchEnabled can be set to YES
 * to allow a node to be selected by a touch event. If the shouldInheritTouchability
 * property is also set to YES, then this touchable capability can also be inherited from
 * a parent node. Selection of nodes based on touch events is handled by CC3Scene. The
 * nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: callback method of your customized CC3Scene will be
 * invoked to indicate which node has been touched.
 *
 * You can cause a wireframe box to be drawn around the node and all its descendants by
 * setting the shouldDrawWireframeBox property to YES. This can be particularly useful
 * during development to locate the boundaries of a node, or to locate a node that is not
 * drawing properly. You can set the default color of this wireframe using the class-side
 * defaultWireframeBoxColor property.
 *
 * You can also cause the name of the node to be displayed where the node is by setting 
 * the shouldDrawDescriptor property to YES. This is also useful for locating a node when
 * debugging rendering problems.
 *
 * To maximize GL throughput, all OpenGL ES 1.1 state is tracked by the singleton instance
 * [CC3OpenGLESEngine engine]. CC3OpenGLESEngine only sends state change calls to the
 * GL engine if GL state really is changing. It is critical that all changes to GL state
 * are made through the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton. When adding or overriding functionality
 * in this framework, do NOT make gl* function calls directly if there is a corresponding
 * state change tracker in the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton. Route the state change request
 * through the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton instead.

/**
 * Specifies the method to be used to scale vertex normals after they have been transformed
 * during vertex drawing.
 *
 * Normal vectors should have a unit length. Since normals are vectors in the local coordinate
 * system of the node, they are transformed into scene and eye coordinates during drawing.
 *
 * During transformation, there are several factors that might distort the normal vector:
 *   - If the normals started out not being of unit length, they will generally be transformed
 *     into vectors that are not of unit length.
 *   - If the transforms are not rigid, and include scaling, even normals that have unit
 *     length in object space will end up shorter or longer than unit length in eye space.
 *   - If the transform scaling is not uniform, the normals will shear, and end up shorter
 *     or longer than unit length.
 *
 * Normals that are not of unit length, or are sheared, will cause portions of the objects
 * to appear lighter or darker after transformation, or will cause specular highlights to
 * actually be dark, distorting the overall look of the material covering the mesh.
 *
 * The GL engine can be instructed to compensate for these transforms by setting this
 * property as follows:
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingNone:
 *     No compensating scaling is performed on the normals after they have been transformed.
 *     This has the highest performance, but will not adjust the normals if they have been
 *     scaled. Use this option if you know that the normals will not be significantly scaled
 *     during transformation.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingRescale:
 *     Uses the modelview matrix to scale all normals by the inverse of the node's overall
 *     scaling. This does have a processing cost, but is much faster than using 
 *     kCC3NormalScalingNormalize. However, it is not as accurate if significantly non-uniform
 *     scaling has been applied to the node.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingNormalize:
 *     Normalizes each norml vector independently. This is the most accurate method, but is
 *     also, by far, the most computationally expensive. Use this method only if selecting
 *     one of the other options does not give you the results that you expect.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingAutomatic:
 *     Chooses the most appropriate method based on the scaling that has been applied to the
 *     node. If no scaling has been applied to the node, kCC3NormalScalingNone will be used.
 *     If only uniform scaling has been applied to the node, kCC3NormalScalingRescale will
 *     be used. If non-uniform scaling has been applied to the node, then
 *     kCC3NormalScalingNormalize will be used.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is kCC3NormalScalingAutomatic. You can generally leave
 * this property at this default value unless you are not getting the results that you expect. 
 *
 * Setting this property sets the corresponding property in all descendant nodes, and affects
 * the processing of normals in all vertex meshes contained in all descendant nodes.

 *   - Mesh data is copied by reference, not by value. Child nodes that support mesh data
 *     will assign it by reference when that child is copied. Mesh data is shared between
 *     both the original mesh node and copy node.

 * method updateBeforeTransform: is automatically invoked before the transformMatrix
 * has been recalculated.
 *

 * will have accurate values when this method is run, since they are only valid after the
 * transformMatrix has been updated. If you need to make use of the global properties
 * of a node (such as for collision detection), override this method.
 *
 * Since the transformMatrix has already been updated when this method is invoked, if
 * you override this method and make any changes to the transform properties (location,

 * that node, to have its transformMatrix, and those of its child nodes, recalculated.
 *
 * This abstract template implementation does nothing. Subclasses that need access to
 * their global transform properties will override accordingly. Subclasses that override
 * do not need to invoke this superclass implementation. Nor do subclasses need to invoke
 * this method on their child nodes. That is performed automatically.

 * is independent of specific frame or update rates. Depending on the setting of the
 * maxUpdateInterval property of the CC3Scene instance, the value of dt may be clamped to
 * an upper limit before being passed to this method. See the description of the CC3Scene
 * maxUpdateInterval property for more information about clamping the update interval.
 * 
 * If you wish to remove this node during an update visitation, avoid invoking the remove
 * method on the node from this method. The visitation process involves iterating through
 * collections of child nodes, and removing a node during the iteration of a collection
 * raises an error. Instead, you can use the requestRemovalOf: method on the visitor,

 *

 * Indicates whether all the CCActions currently running on this node and all
 * descendants should be stopped and removed when this node is removed from its parent.
 *
 * If the value of this property is YES, when this node is removed from its parent, the cleanupActions
 * method will automatically be invoked. If the value of this method is NO, when this node is removed
 * from its parent, the isRunning property will be set to NO, which causes all actions to be paused,
 * but not removed.
 *
 * Stopping and removing CCActions is important because the actions running on a node retain links
 * to the node. If the actions are simply paused, those links will be retained forever, potentially
 * creating memory leaks of nodes that are invisibly retained by their actions.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is YES, indicating that all actions will be stopped and removed
 * when this node is removed from its parent. If you have reason to want the actions to be paused but
 * not removed when removing this node from its parent, set this property to NO.
 *
 * One example of such a situation is when you use the addChild: method to move a node from one
 * parent to another. As part of the processing of the addChild: method, if the node already has
 * a parent, it is automatically removed from its current parent. The addChild: method temporarily
 * sets this property to NO so that the actions are not destroyed during the move.
 *
 * If you have some other reason for setting this property to NO, be sure to set it back to YES before
 * this node, or the ancestor node assembly that this node belongs to is removed for good, otherwise
 * this node will continue to be retained by any actions running on this node, and this node will not
 * be deallocated.
 *
 * Alternately, if you have this property set to NO, you can manually stop and remove all actions
 * using the cleanupActions method.
