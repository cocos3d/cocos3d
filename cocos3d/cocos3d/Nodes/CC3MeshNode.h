/**
 * A CC3Node that draws a 3D mesh.
 * This class forms the base of all visible 3D mesh models in the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3MeshNode is a type of CC3Node, and will often participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the mesh node itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * CC3MeshNodes encapsulate a CC3Mesh instance, and a CC3Material instance. The CC3Mesh instance
 * contains the mesh vertex content. The CC3Material instance describes the material and texture
 * properties covering the mesh, which can be affected by lighting conditions.
 *
 * If it is not explicitly set beforehand, the material will automatically be created and assigned 
 * to the mesh node when a texture is added to the mesh node through the texture property or the
 * addTexture: method, or if any of the material properties of the mesh node are set or accessed,
 * including color, opacity, ambientColor, diffuseColor, specularColor, emissionColor, blendFunc,
 * isOpaque, shouldUseLighting, or shouldDrawLowAlpha.
 *
 * There are a number of populateAs... parametric population methods available in the CC3MeshNode
 * (ParametricShapes) category extension. These methods can be used to populate the vertices of the
 * mesh contained in a new mesh node to create interesting and useful parametric shapes and surfaces.
 *
 * When this node is drawn, it delegates to the mesh instance to render the mesh vertices. 
 * Before drawing the mesh, it delegates to the material to configure the covering of the mesh.
 *
 * Each CC3MeshNode can have only one material. For large, complicated meshes that are 
 * covered by more than one material, the mesh must be broken into smaller meshes, each
 * of which is covered by a single material. These smaller sub-meshes are sometimes 
 * referred to as "vertex groups". Each such sub-mesh is then wrapped in its own CC3MeshNode
 * instance, along with the material that covers that sub-mesh.
 *
 * These CC3MeshNode instances can then be added as child nodes to a single parent CC3Node instance.
 * This parent CC3Node can then be moved, rotated and scaled, and all of its child nodes will
 * transform in sync. The assembly will behave and be seen as a single object.
 *
 * When the mesh is set in the mesh property, the CC3MeshNode instance creates and builds a
 * CC3NodeBoundingVolume instance from the mesh data, and sets it into its boundingVolume property. 
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3MeshNode instance using the copy method, a copy is made of the material,
 * but the mesh is simply assigned by reference, and is not copied. The result is that the the new and
 * original nodes will have different materials, but will share the same mesh. This design avoids
 * creating multiple copies of volumnious and static mesh data when creating copies of nodes.
 *
 * Normally, the front faces of a mesh are displayed, and the back faces are culled and not displayed.
 * You can change this behaviour if you need to be changing the values of the shouldCullFrontFaces and
 * shouldCullBackFaces properties. An example might be if you wanted to show the back-side of a planar
 * sign, or if you wanted to show the inside faces of a skybox.
 *
 * However, be aware that culling is a significant performance-improving technique. You should avoid
 * disabling backface culling except where specifically needed for visual effect. And when you do,
 * if you only need the back faces, turn on front face culling for that mesh by setting the
 * shouldCullFrontFaces property to YES.

#pragma mark Vertex management

/**
 * Indicates the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Each vertex can contain several types of content, optionally including location, normal,
 * color, texture coordinates, along with other specialized content for certain specialized
 * meshes. To identify this various content, this property is a bitwise-OR of flags that
 * enumerate the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Valid component flags of this property include:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTangent
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBitangent
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBoneWeights
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBoneIndices
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize
 *
 * To indicate that this mesh should contain particular vertex content, construct a
 * bitwise-OR combination of one or more of the component types listed above, and set
 * this property to that combined value.
 *
 * Setting this property affects the underlying mesh. When this property is set, if a mesh
 * has not yet been set in the mesh property of this node, a new CC3Mesh, set to interleave
 * vertex content, will automatically be created and set into the mesh property of this node.
 *
 * When setting this property, if the kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates component is not
 * included, the texture property will be set to nil. If the kCC3VertexContentNormal component
 * is not included, the shouldUseLighting property will be set to NO automatically.
 *
 * This property is a convenience property. You can also construct the mesh by managing the
 * vertex content directly by assigning specific vertex arrays to the appropriate properties
 * on the underlying mesh.
 *
 * The mesh constructed by this property will be configured to use interleaved data if the
 * shouldInterleaveVertices property of the mesh is set to YES. You should ensure the value
 * of the shouldInterleaveVertices property of the underlying mesh is set to the desired value
 * before setting the value of this property. The initial value of the shouldInterleaveVertices
 * property is YES.
 *
 * If the content is interleaved, for each vertex, the content is held in the structures identified in
 * the list above, in the order that they appear in the list. You can use this consistent organization
 * to create an enclosing structure to access all data for a single vertex, if it makes it easier to
 * access vertex content that way. If vertex content is not specified, it is simply absent, and the content
 * from the following type will be concatenated directly to the content from the previous type.
 *
 * For instance, in a typical textured and illuminated mesh, you might not require per-vertex
 * color, tangent and bitangent content. You would therefore omit the kCC3VertexContentColor,
 * kCC3VertexContentTangent and kCC3VertexContentBitangent values in the bitmask when setting
 * this property, and the resulting structure for each vertex would be a location CC3Vector,
 * followed by a normal CC3Vector, followed immediately by a texture coordinate ccTex2F.
 * You can then define an enclosing structure to hold and manage all content for a single vertex.
 * In this particular example, this is already done for you with the CC3TexturedVertex structure.
 *
 * You can declare and use such a custom vertex structure even if you have constructed the vertex
 * arrays directly, without using this property. The structure of the content of a single vertex
 * is the same in either case.
 *
 * The vertex arrays created in the underlying mesh by this property cover the most common use
 * cases and data formats. If you require more customized vertex arrays, you can use this property
 * to create the typical mesh content, and then customize the mesh, by accessing the vertex arrays
 * individually through their respective properties on the mesh. After doing so, if the vertex
 * content is interleaved, you should invoke the updateVertexStride method on the mesh to
 * automatically align the elementOffset and vertexStride properties of all of the vertex arrays.
 * After setting this property, you do not need to invoke the updateVertexStride method unless
 * you subsequently make changes to the constructed vertex arrays.
 *
 * It is safe to set this property more than once. Doing so will remove any existing vertex arrays
 * and replace them with those indicated by this property.
 *
 * When reading this property, the appropriate bitwise-OR values are returned, corresponding to
 * the mesh vertex arrays, even if those arrays were constructed directly, instead of through
 * setting this property. If this mesh contains no vertex arrays, this property will return
 * kCC3VertexContentNone.
