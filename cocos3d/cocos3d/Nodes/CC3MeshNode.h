#pragma mark CC3MeshNode

/**
 * A CC3Node that draws a 3D mesh.
 * This class forms the base of all visible 3D mesh models in the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3MeshNode is a type of CC3Node, and will often participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the mesh node itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * CC3MeshNodes encapsulate a CC3Mesh instance, and can also encapsulate either a CC3Material
 * instance, or a pure color. The CC3Mesh instance contains the mesh vertex data. The CC3Material
 * instance describes the material and texture properties covering the mesh, which are affected by
 * lighting conditions. Alternately, instead of a material, the mesh may be colored by a single
 * pure color via the pureColor property.
 *
 * If it is not explicitly set beforehand, the material will automatically be created and assigned 
 * to the mesh node when a texture is added to the mesh node through the texture property or the
 * addTexture: method, or if any of the material properties of the mesh node are set or accessed,
 * including color, opacity, ambientColor, diffuseColor, specularColor, emissionColor, blendFunc,
 * or shouldDrawLowAlpha. The material will automatically be created if either the isOpaque or
 * shouldUseLighting property is set, but not if they are simply read.
 *
 * There are a number of populateAs... parametric population methods available in the CC3MeshNode
 * (ParametricShapes) category extension. These methods can be used to populate the vertices of the
 * mesh contained in a new mesh node to create interesting and useful parametric shapes and surfaces.
 *
 * When this node is drawn, it delegates to the mesh instance to render the mesh vertices. If a
 * material is defined, before drawing the mesh, it delegates to the material to configure the
 * covering of the mesh. If no material is defined, the node establishes its pure color before
 * rendering the mesh. The pure color is only used if the node has no material attached. And the
 * pure color may in turn be overridden by the mesh data if vertex coloring is in use.
 *
 * Each CC3MeshNode can have only one material or pure color. For large, complicated meshes that are
 * covered by more than one material, or colored with more than one color, the mesh must be broken
 * into smaller meshes, each of which are covered by a single material or color. These smaller
 * sub-meshes are sometimes referred to as "vertex groups". Each such sub-mesh is then wrapped in
 * its own CC3MeshNode instance, along with the material that covers that sub-mesh.
 *
 * These CC3MeshNode instances can then be added as child nodes to a single parent CC3Node instance.
 * This parent CC3Node can then be moved, rotated and scaled, and all of its child nodes will
 * transform in sync. The assembly will behave and be seen as a single object.
 *
 * When the mesh is set in the mesh property, the CC3MeshNode instance creates and builds a
 * CC3NodeBoundingVolume instance from the mesh data, and sets it into its boundingVolume property. 
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3MeshNode instance using the copy method, a copy is made of the material,
 * but the mesh is simply assigned by reference, and is not copied. The result is that the the new and
 * original nodes will have different materials, but will share the same mesh. This design avoids
 * creating multiple copies of volumnious and static mesh data when creating copies of nodes.
 *
 * Normally, the front faces of a mesh are displayed, and the back faces are culled and not displayed.
 * You can change this behaviour if you need to be changing the values of the shouldCullFrontFaces and
 * shouldCullBackFaces properties. An example might be if you wanted to show the back-side of a planar
 * sign, or if you wanted to show the inside faces of a skybox.
 *
 * However, be aware that culling is a significant performance-improving technique. You should avoid
 * disabling backface culling except where specifically needed for visual effect. And when you do,
 * if you only need the back faces, turn on front face culling for that mesh by setting the
 * shouldCullFrontFaces property to YES.

 * meshes. To identify this various content, this property is a bitwise-OR of flags that
 * enumerate the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Valid component flags of this property include:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize
 *   - kCC3VertexContentWeights
 *   - kCC3VertexContentMatrixIndices
 *
 * To indicate that this mesh should contain particular vertex content, construct a
 * bitwise-OR combination of one or more of the component types listed above, and set
 * this property to that combined value.
 *
 * Setting this property affects the underlying mesh. When this property is set, if a mesh has
 * not yet been set in the mesh property of this node, a new CC3VertexArrayMesh, set to interleave
 * vertex data, will automatically be created and set into the mesh property of this node.
 *
 * When setting this property, if the kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates component is not
 * included, the texture property will be set to nil. If the kCC3VertexContentNormal component
 * is not included, the shouldUseLighting property will be set to NO automatically.
 *
 * This property is a convenience property. You can also construct the mesh by managing the
 * content directly within the underlying mesh. The effect that this property has on the internal

 * notes for this propety on the CC3VertexArrayMesh, CC3PointParticleMesh, and CC3SkinMesh classes
 * for more details, and specific use cases with those mesh subclasses.
 *
 * Not all meshes can contain all of the vertex content itemized above. In general, all
 * meshes can contain the first four vertex content types. Specialized mesh subclasses
 * can contain other combinations as follows:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize is accepted by CC3PointParticleEmitter in support of point particles.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentWeights and kCC3VertexContentMatrixIndices are accepted by CC3SkinMeshNode
 *     in support of skinned meshes controlled by bone-rigging.
 *
 * Meshes that do not support a particular vertex component type will silently ignore that

 * Populates the specified array with information about the intersections of the specified ray

 *
 * This method returns the actual number of intersections found (up to the specified maximum).
 * This value indicates how many of the elements of the specifed intesections array were populated
 * during the execution of this method. The contents of elements beyond that number are undefined.
 *
 * Each of the populated elements of the intersections array contains information about the face
 * on which the intersection occurred, the location of the intersection, and the distance from the
 * ray startLocation where the intersection occurred. The location and distance components are
 * specified in the local coordinates system of this mesh.
 *
 * The intersections array is not sorted in any way. In particular, when the array contains multiple
 * entries, the first element in the array does not necessily contain the closest intersection.
 * If you need to determine the closest intersection, you can iterate the intersections array and
 * compare the values of the location element of each intersection.
 *
 * To use this method, allocate an array of CC3MeshIntersection structures, pass a reference to it
 * in the intersections parameter, and indicate the size of that array in the maxHitCount parameter.
 *
 * The method iterates through the faces in the mesh until the indicated number of intersections are
 * found, or until all the faces in the mesh have been inspected. Therefore, to keep performance high,
 * you should set the maxHitCount parameter no higher than the number of intersections that are useful
 * to you. For example, specifiying a value of one for the maxHitCount parameter will cause this method
 * to return as soon as the first intersection is found. In most cases, this is all that is needed.
 * 
 * The allowBackFaces parameter is used to indicate whether to include intersections where the ray
 * pierces a face from its back face. Typically, this means that the ray has intersected the face
 * as the ray exits on the far side of the mesh. In most cases you will interested only where the
 * ray intersects the near side of the mesh, in which case you can set this parameter to NO.
 *
 * The allowBehind parameter is used to indicate whether to include intersections that occur behind
 * the startLocation of the ray, in the direction opposite to the direction of the ray. Typically,
 * this might mean the mesh is located behind the ray startLocation, or it might mean the ray starts
 * inside the mesh. Again,in most cases, you will be interested only in intersections that occur in
 * the direction the ray is pointing, and can ususally set this parameter to NO.
