/**
 * This CC3Node displays a 2D cocos2d CCNode as part of the 3D scene.
 *
 * The 2D node can be displayed in one of two ways, as determined by the value of
 * the shouldDrawAs2DOverlay property:
 *
 *   - When shouldDrawAs2DOverlay is set to NO (the default), the 2D CCNode will
 *     be embedded in the 3D scene and will be drawn at the Z-depth of this node.
 *     Like all 3D nodes, the 2D node will be occluded if other 3D nodes are between
 *     this node and the camera, it can be rotated in 3D to face away from the camera,
 *     and can be selected by touch events.
 *
 *   - When shouldDrawAs2DOverlay is set to YES, the 2D CCNode will be drawn at the
 *     projectedPosition of this node, after the 3D scene has completed drawing,
 *     and the GL engine has reverted to 2D rendering. The 2D node will ignore 3D
 *     depth testing, and will be drawn on top of all 3D nodes, even if there are
 *     other 3D nodes between this node and the camera. The 2D node will always appear
 *     to face directly towards the camera, and cannot be selected by touch events.
 *
 * CC3Billboards are useful for drawing a label, health-bar, speech-balloon, or some
 * other 2D artifact in or on the 3D scene, and have that 2D artifact move along with
 * this node as it moves through the 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3Billboard is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural
 * node assembly. An instance can be the child of another node, and the CC3Billboard
 * itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * The size of the 2D node will be automatically scaled based on the distance between
 * the 3D billboard node and the 3D camera to keep the 2D artifact at the correct
 * perspective as this node moves toward or away from the camera.
 *
 * The perspective sizing of the 2D node can be influenced by two properties:
 * minimumBillboardScale and maximumBillboardScale, which can define a minimum and
 * maximum limits to which the node will be sized, respectively, relative to a nominal
 * size. This capability is useful when the 2D node is a label, health-bar, or
 * speech-balloon, and it is desirable to keep the text at a readable size, regardless
 * of how near or far the node moves in the 3D scene, relative to the camera.
 *
 * Since the scale of the 2D billboard is often automatically adjusted, you should be
 * careful when setting the scale property of the 2D billboard. In particular, when
 * the 2D node is embedded in the 3D scene, (the shouldDrawAs2DOverlay property is set
 * to the default NO), the scale property of the 2D node will be directly manipulated
 * if the value of the shouldNormalizeScaleToDevice property on this CC3Billboard is
 * set to YES, and any value you set for the 2D node scale property will be ignored.
 *
 * As with all CC3Nodes, CC3Billboards support the protocol CCRGBAProtocol.
 * When wrapping a 2D CCNode billboard that also supports CCRGBAProtocol, changes to
 * the CC3Billboard color and opacity properties will change those same properties in
 * the encapsulated 2D CCNode billboard. When reading the color and opacity properties
 * of the CC3Billboard, the value returned will be that of the 2D CCNode.
 *
 * A CC3Billboard can, and should, have a bounding volume, but the bounding volume must be an
 * instance of a subclass of CC3NodeBoundingArea, which maps the 2D boundary of the 2D node
 * into the 3D scene, and when shouldDrawAs2DOverlay is YES, handles testing the 2D bounds of
 * the 2D node against the bounds of the 2D drawing plane. The default bounding volume, as
 * returned by the defaultBoundingVolume method, and created when the createBoundingVolume
 * method is invoked, is an instance of CC3BillboardBoundingBoxArea.

/**
 * The rectangle, in pixels, bounding the 2D CCNode, in the local coordinate system
 * of the 2D node. This property is used by cocos3d when each frame is drawn, to test
 * whether this node is within the field of view of the camera and should be drawn.
 * It is accessed on each rendering frame. The value of this property is also used
 * when picking nodes from touch events.
 *
 * The value of this property can be set directly, or it can be measured automatically
 * from the size of the 2D node when accesssed as follows:
 *
 *  - If the value of this property is left unset, the value will be lazily measured
 *    from the size of the 2D node the first time this property is accessed. The value
 *    of this property will then be cached for subsequent accesses, and will not be
 *    remeasured from the 2D node unless the resetBillboardBoundingRect method is invoked.
 *  - If the value of either of the shouldAlwaysMeasureBillboardBoundingRect or
 *    shouldDrawAs2DOverlay properties is YES, the value of this property will be
 *    measured from the size of the 2D node each time this property is accessed.
 *  - If the value of the shouldMaximizeBillboardBoundingRect property is YES,
 *    the value of this property will be measured from the size of the 2D node each
 *    time this property is accessed, and the maximum value of this property will be
 *    retained. In this situation, for a 2D node that changes shape and size over time,
 *    such as a particle system, the value of this property will grow over time to to
 *    the maximum size that the 2D node has become since this property was initialized
 *    or last reset using the resetBillboardBoundingRect method.
 *
 * The choice of how to use this property depends on the type of 2D node being held.
 * If the value of the shouldDrawAs2DOverlay property is set to NO (the default),
 * the 2D node is embedded in the 3D scene, and the following applies:
 *  - For static 2D nodes, such as buttons, 2D sprites, or static text labels, the
 *    simplest thing to do is leave this property with the default value and allow
 *    it to be lazily measured from the 2D node the first time it is accessed, and
 *    cached for subsequent accesses.
 *  - For 2D nodes whose boundary change under app control, such as a text label,
 *    you can also allow this property to be lazily initialized, and then use the
 *    resetBillboardBoundingRect method whenever you know the size or shape of the
 *    2D node has changed (eg- the text of the label has changed), to reset this
 *    property so that it will be measured again from the 2D node the next time this
 *    property is accessed.
 *  - For 2D nodes whose boundary changes dynamically, such as a text label that is
 *    frequently changed, or a 2D node whose scale or rotation changes under control
 *    of a CCAction, or a particle system, you can cause the boundary of the 2D node
 *    to be measured on each access of this property by setting the value of the
 *    shouldAlwaysMeasureBillboardBoundingRect property to YES.
 *  - For a particle system with many particles, measuring the boundary of the 2D
 *    every time this property is accessed (which is on each rendering frame) can
 *    be very computationally expensive. For a particle system that has a reasonable
 *    maximum boundary (like a flame, explosion, etc), you can pre-compute the
 *    boundary, and explicitly set this property to that pre-computed value.
 *    If the value of the shouldAlwaysMeasureBillboardBoundingRect property is left
 *    set to NO, then this pre-computed boundary will be retained and used for the
 *    life of the particle system, and the boundary will not be measured on each
 *    frame render.
 *  - To pre-compute the maximum boundary of a dynamic node like a particle system,
 *    you can temporarily set the shouldMaximizeBillboardBoundingRect property to
 *    YES (either at development time, or runtime start-up), running the particle
 *    system, and then extracting (or logging at development time) the maximum
 *    boundary that is accumulated.
 *  - For a particle system that spans a large amount of screen space, like rain
 *    or stars, you can either pre-compute a large boundary, or simply set the
 *    boundingVolume of this node to nil, in which case this property will be
 *    ignored, and the particle system will be drawn on every frame render,
 *    regardless of where the camera is pointed.
 *
 * If the shouldDrawAs2DOverlay property is set to YES, the 2D node will be drawn as
 * a 2D overlay, and the value of this property will be measured from the 2D node each
 * time this property is accessed. This is because the boundary of the 2D overlay node
 * changes dynamically as either the node or the camera is moved.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is CGRectNull. If this node contains a 2D node,
 * the value returned will be measured from the 2D node the first time this property
 * is accessed, and cached for future access. If this node does not contain a 2D node,
 * this property will simply return the CGRectNull value.

 * not in view.
 *
 * Since setting this property to NO will cause this node to attempt to pause and resume scheduled

/**
 * A CC3Billboard node customized to display and manage a cocos2d 2D CCParticleSystem.
 *
 * This specialized subclass adds some specific features to aid with drawing particle
 * systems, including:
 *   - Setting the particle size attenuation before drawing.
 *   - If the CCParticleSystem has a finite duration and its autoRemoveOnFinish property
 *     is set to YES, the CC3ParticleSystemBillboard node is automatically removed from
 *     its parent once the particle system has finished emitting.
 *   - In cocos2d, particle systems draw all particles at the same Z-distance.
 *     When undergoing transforms in the 3D scene, the result is that the Z-distances
 *     are very close but not equal, resulting in Z-fighting between the particles.
 *     To avoid this, if the shouldDisableDepthMask property is set to YES, the GL depth
 *     mask is temporarily disabled during drawing so that particles will not update the
 *     depth buffer, meaning that the Z-distance of each particle will be compared against
 *     previously drawn objects, but not against each other. For CC3Billboard, the default
 *     value of the shouldDisableDepthMask is YES, indicating that the GL depth mask will
 *     be disabled during the drawing of the particles.

/**
 * CC3NodeDescriptor is a type of CC3Billboard specialized for attaching a descriptive
 * text label to another node. A CC3NodeDescriptor is typically added as a child node
 * to the node whose description is to be displayed.
 *
 * Since we don't want to add descriptor labels or wireframe boxes to
 * descriptor nodes, the shouldDrawDescriptor, shouldDrawWireframeBox,
 * and shouldDrawLocalContentWireframeBox properties are overridden to
 * do nothing when set, and to always return YES.
 *
 * Similarly, CC3NodeDescriptor node does not participate in calculating the
 * bounding box of the node whose bounding box it is drawing, since, as a child
 * of that node, it would interfere with accurate measurement of the bounding box.
 *
 * The shouldIncludeInDeepCopy property returns NO, so that the CC3NodeDescriptor
 * will not be copied when the parent node is copied. A descriptor node for the copy
 * will be created automatically when the shouldDrawDescriptor property is copied,
 * if it was set to YES on the original node that is copied.
 * 
 * A CC3NodeDescriptor will continue to be visible even when its ancestor
 * nodes are invisible, unless the CC3NodeDescriptor itself is made invisible.
