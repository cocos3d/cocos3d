/**
 * A CC3ResourceNode is a CC3Node that that can be populated from a CC3NodesResource, and
 * forms the root of the node structural assembly loaded from a resource file.
 *
 * This is an abstract class, and subclasses are specialized for loading different types
 * of resource files.
 *
 * A subclass instance can be populated in one of several ways:
 *   - The most common way is to invoke one of the initialization methods that specify a
 *     path to a resource file.
 *   - Or, an instance can be instantiated, and then populated by invoking one of the
 *     loadFromFile:... methods.
 *   - Or, if a compatible resource has already been loaded, this instance can be instantiated,
 *     and then populated using the populateFromResource: method.
 *
 * Under iOS, a texture whose width and height are not each a power-of-two, will be converted
 * to a size whose width and height are a power-of-two. The result is a texture that can have
 * empty space on the top and right sides. If the texture coordinates of the mesh do not take
 * this into consideration, the result will be that only the lower left of the mesh will be
 * covered by the texture.
 * 
 * In addition, the vertical axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative 
 * to the iOS view coordinate system. This results in textures being displayed upside-down,
 * relative to the OpenGL coordinate system.
 *
 * The CC3NodesResource that actually loads the file content will automatically adjust the 
 * meshes to compensate for this. Meshes loaded by this resource loader will have their 
 * texture coordinates adjusted to align with the usable area of an NPOT texture, and to
 * vertically flip a texture that has been loaded upside-down.
 *
 * To determine whether textures will need to be vertically flipped, the loader needs to know
 * whether or not the meshes have already been flipped (by the 3D editor or file exporter).
 * The initialization and loading methods have an option to pass an indication of whether
 * the texture coordinates have already been flipped.
