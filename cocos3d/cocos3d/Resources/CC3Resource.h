/**
 * CC3Resource is a wrapper class around a resource structure loaded from a data file
 * containing 3D resources. It handles loading model and texture data from files, and
 * creating CC3Nodes from that data.
 *
 * The loadFromFile: method is used to load this resource. Once this method has been
 * successfully invoked, access to 3D data objects loaded from the file is through
 * the nodes property, which contains the root nodes of a structural 3D node assembly
 * constructed from the 3D data loaded from the file.
 *
 * As shortcuts, there are also class and instance initialization methods that will
 * invoke the loadFromFile: method automatically during instance initialization.
 *
 * However, before using any of these shortcut methods, you should take into
 * consideration whether you need to set the directory or expectsVerticallyFlippedTextures
 * properties prior to loading, as explained here.
 *
 * By default, additional resources (typically textures), are loaded from the same
 * directory that the file containing the content of this resource is located.
 * If this is not the case, you can set the directory property prior to invoking
 * the loadFromFile: method, in order to establish another directory from which
 * additional resources such as textures will be loaded.
 *
 * You do not need to set the directory property if these additional resources
 * are in the same directory as the file loaded by this resource.
 *
 * Under iOS, a texture whose width and height are not each a power-of-two, will be
 * converted to a size whose width and height are a power-of-two. The result is a
 * texture that can have empty space on the top and right sides. If the texture
 * coordinates of the mesh do not take this into consideration, the result will be
 * that only the lower left of the mesh will be covered by the texture.
 * 
 * In addition, the vertical axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted
 * relative to the iOS view coordinate system. This results in textures being
 * displayed upside-down, relative to the OpenGL coordinate system.
 *
 * This instance will automatically adjust the meshes to compensate for this.
 * Meshes loaded by this resource loader will have their texture coordinates
 * adjusted to align with the usable area of an NPOT texture, and to vertically
 * flip a texture that has been loaded upside-down.
 *
 * To determine whether textures will need to be vertically flipped, the loader
 * needs to know whether or not the meshes have already been flipped (by the 3D
 * editor or file exporter). The expectsVerticallyFlippedTextures property
 * can be set to indicate to the loader whether the texture coordinates have
 * already been flipped. If the value of this property needs to be changed,
 * it should be set before the file is loaded.
 *
 * The class-side property defaultExpectsVerticallyFlippedTextures can be
 * used to set all instances to load one way or the other.
 *
 * This is an abstract class. Specific subclasses will load files of specific types.
 *
 * Subclasses must override the primitive template method processFile:. All other
 * loading and initialization methods defined by this class are implemented using
 * this primitive method, and subclasses do not need to override any of these other
 * loading and initialization methods.
 *
 * Subclasses should ensure that the nodes array property is fully populated upon
 * successful completion of the processFile: method.

#pragma mark Aligning texture coordinates to NPOT and iOS-inverted textures

/**
 * Indicates whether the texture coordinates of the meshes that will be loaded
 * by this resource loader expect that the texture will be flipped upside-down
 * during texture loading.
 * 
 * The vertical axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative to
 * the iOS view coordinate system. This results in textures from most file formats
 * being oriented upside-down, relative to the OpenGL coordinate system. All file
 * formats except PVR format will be oriented upside-down after loading.
 *
 * If the value of this property is YES, the texture coordinates of meshes loaded
 * by this resource loader will be assumed to have already been flipped vertically,
 * (typically by the 3D editor or file exporter) to align with textures that will
 * be vertically flipped by the texture loader.
 *
 * If the value of this property is NO, the texture coordinates of meshes loaded
 * by this resource loader will be assumed to have their original orientation, and
 * aligned with textures that have not been vertically flipped by the texture loader.
 *
 * The value of this property is then used to cause the meshes to automatically
 * correctly align themselves with the orientation of any texture applied to them.
 *
 * For meshes that are based on vertex arrays, this property is used to set the
 * same property on each CC3VertexTextureCoordinates instance created and loaded
 * by this resource. When a texture is assigned to cover the mesh, the value of
 * that CC3VertexTextureCoordinates property is used in combination with the value
 * of the isFlippedVertically property of a texture to determine whether the texture
 * coordinates should automatically be reoriented when displaying that texture.
 * 
 * The initial value of this property is determined by the value of the class-side
 * defaultExpectsVerticallyFlippedTextures property at the time an instance of
 * this class is created and initialized. If you want all meshes to behave the same
 * way, with respect to this property, set the value of that class-side property.
