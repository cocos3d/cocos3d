/**
 * CC3GLProgramMatcher describes the behaviour required to match nodes and materials to an
 * appropriate GL program for rendering a particular node.
 *
 * Under OpenGL ES 2, every drawable mesh node requires a CC3GLProgram to be rendered. Typically,
 * the application will deliberately assign a specific GL program to each material, through the
 * shaderProgram or shaderContext properties of the material, and in some cases, this may be
 * defined during model loading from resources.
 *
 * When a model is created or loaded without a specific CC3GLProgram assigned, the material will retrieve
 * an appropriate default shader from the shader cache. The shader cache maintains an instance of an
 * implementation of this protocol and delegates to it to match the model to a suitable GL program.
 */

/**
 * Returns the CC3GLProgram to use for the specified mesh node. The application can use this as
 * a convenient way to determine a suitable program to attach to the material of each mesh node.
 *
 * The returned program will be compiled and linked, and will have a semantics delegate assigned
 * in the semanticDelegate property.
 *
 * The implementation is responsible for determining how to match the specified mesh node to an 
 * appropriate GL program, and each implementations may have a different matching methodology.
 *
 * This method does not have each access to scene content such as lighting conditions. Because of
 * this, the application may choose to avoid using this method, and allow a suitable program to
 * be selected by the programForVisitor: method. 
 *
 * Implementations are also responsible for compiling, linking, and assigning a semantics

 * state of the specified visitor. The implementation can query the visitor for current state
 * such as the currentMaterial, currentMeshNode, lightCount, or shouldDecorateNode properties,
 * etc, to determine the appropriate program to return.
 *
 * This method is invoked automatically the first time a mesh node is rendered if it does not
 * have a program assigned to its material. Since the attached visitor has access to scene state,
 * in addition to information about the mesh node, the application may choose to skip setting the
 * program into the mesh node material at initialization time, and may instead allow this method
 * to determine the most suitable program the first time the node is rendered.
