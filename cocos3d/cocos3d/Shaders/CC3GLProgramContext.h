/**

 *
 * A single CC3GLProgram object can be used by many nodes and other contexts. The CC3GLProgramContext
 * contains state and behaviour specific to a particular use of the program, including providing
 * storage for local values for certain customized program variables in use by the node.
 *
 * A particular program may make use of many uniforms. In most, or many, cases, the uniform will 
 * have a semantic defined, and the content of the uniform will automatically be extracted from
 * the environment, including from the content of the node itself. For uniforms without a defined
 * semantic, the content of the uniform must be set by accessing it through this program context.
 *
 * When retrieving a uniform variable through this program context, be aware that the content value
 * of any uniform variable with a defined semantic is derived automatically from the environment,
 * and cannot be retrieved or set directly.

 * during each frame update or render cycle. Once set, the content of this uniform will automatically
 * be applied to the GL engine for this context (typically a CC3MeshNode), on each render cycle.

 * for populating the value of this overriden uniform, by invoking any of the set... methods on the
