/** 
 * The root class of a class cluster representing textures that are loaded into the GL engine.
 *
 * Since a single GL texture can be used by many nodes and materials, GL textures are cached.
 * The application can use the class-side getGLTextureNamed: method to retrieve a loaded texture
 * from the cache, and the class-side addGLTexture: method to add a new texture to the cache.
 * See the notes of those two methods for more details.
 * 
 * When creating an instance on a single texture file, the textureFromFile: method can be used to
 * check the cache for an existing instance, and to automatically load an instance into the cache
 * from that file if it has not already been loaded.
 *
 * CC3GLTexture is the root of a class cluster for loading different file types. Depending on the
 * file type, the initFromFile: and textureFromFile: methods may return an instance of a class that
 * is different than the receiver. You can use the textureClassForFile: method to determine the
 * cluster subclass whose instance will be returned by these methods for a particular file.
 *
 * To improve both performance and texture quality, by default, instances whose width and height
 * are a power-of-two (see the isPOT property) automatically generate a mipmap when a texture is
 * loaded. If you do not want mipmaps to be generated automatically, set the class-side
 * shouldGenerateMipmaps property to NO. With automatic mipmap generation turned off, you can
 * selectively generate a mipmap on any single CC3GLTexture instance by using the generateMipmap
 * method. In addition, textures that contain mipmaps within the file content (PVR files may contain
 * mipmaps) will retain and use this mipmap. See the shouldGenerateMipmaps and hasMipmap properties,
 * and the generateMipmap method for more information.
 *
 * Under iOS and OSX, most texture formats are loaded updside-down. This is because the vertical
 * axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative to the iOS or OSX view coordinate
 * system. The isFlippedVerically property can be used to ensure that textures are displayed with
 * the correct orientation. When a CC3Texture is applied to a mesh, the mesh will be adjusted
 * automatically if the texture is vertically flipped.
 *
 * Generally, you do not use this class cluster directly. Instead, you will typically load textures
 * through the CC3Texture class, which will manage access to the correct instance of this class cluster.

/**
 * Initializes this instance by loading the six cube face textures using the specified pattern
 * string as a string format template to derive the names of the six textures, and returns whether
 * all six files were successfully loaded.
 *
 * This method expects the six required files to have identical paths and names, except that
 * each should contain one of the following character substrings in the same place in each
 * file path: "PosX", "NegX", "PosY", "NegY", "PosZ", "NegZ".
 *
 * The specified file path pattern should include one standard NSString format marker %@ at
 * the point where one of the substrings in the list above should be substituted.
 *
 * As an example, the file path pattern MyCubeTex%@.png would be expanded by this method
 * to load the following six textures:
 *  - MyCubeTexPosX.png
 *  - MyCubeTexNegX.png
 *  - MyCubeTexPosY.png
 *  - MyCubeTexNegY.png
 *  - MyCubeTexPosZ.png
 *  - MyCubeTexNegZ.png
 *
 * The format marker can occur anywhere in the file name. It does not need to occur at the
 * end as in this example.
 *
 * The specified file path pattern may be either an absolute path, or a path relative to
 * the application resource directory. If the file is located directly in the application
 * resources directory, the specified file path pattern can simply be the file name pattern.
 *
 * If the class-side shouldGenerateMipmaps property is set to YES, a mipmap will be generated
 * for the texture automatically.
 *
 * The name of this instance is set to the unqualified file name derived from substituting
 * an empty string into the format marker in the specified file path pattern string.
 *
 * Returns nil if any of the six files could not be loaded.

 * Textures loaded through this method are cached. If the texture was already loaded and is in

 * placed into the cache, indexed by its name, and returned. It is therefore safe to invoke this
 * method any time the texture is needed, without having to worry that the texture will be
 * repeatedly loaded from file.
 *
 * To clear a texture instance from the cache, use the removeGLTexture: method.
 *
 * To load the file directly, bypassing the cache, use the alloc and initFromFilePattern: 
 * methods. This technique can be used to load the same texture twice, if needed for some reason.
 * Each distinct instance can then be given its own name, and added to the cache separately.
 * However, when choosing to do so, be aware that textures often consume significant memory.
 *
 * Returns nil if the texture is not in the cache and any of the six files could not be loaded.
