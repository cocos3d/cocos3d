/** 
 * CC3Material manages information about a material that is used to cover one or more meshes.
 * This includes:
 *   - color
 *   - texture
 *   - interaction with lighting
 *   - opacity, translucency, and blending with background objects
 *
 * CC3Material supports two levels of control for blending and translucency:
 *   - To achieve the highest level of detail, accuracy and realism, you can individually
 *     set the explicit ambientColor, diffuseColor, specularColor, emissiveColor, shininess,
 *     sourceBlend, and destinationBlend properties. This suite of properties gives you the
 *     most complete control over the appearance of the material and its interaction with
 *     lighting conditions and the colors of the objects behind it, allowing you to generate
 *     rich visual effects. In addition, the isOpaque property sets the most commonly used
 *     blending combinations, and can be used to simplify your management of blending opaque
 *     or transparent materials, while still providing fine control of the ambient, diffuse
 *     and specular coloring.
 *   - At a simpler level, CC3Material also supports the cocos2d <CCRGBAProtocol> protocol.
 *     You can use the color and opacity properties of this protocol to set the most commonly
 *     used coloring and blending characteristics simply and easily. Setting the color property
 *     changes both the ambient and diffuse colors of the material in tandem. Setting the
 *     opacity property also automatically sets the source and destination blend functions to
 *     appropriate values for the opacity level. By using the color and opacity properties,
 *     you will not be able to achieve the complexity and realism that you can by using the
 *     more detailed properties, but you can achieve good effect with much less effort.
 *     And by supporting the <CCRGBAProtocol> protocol, the coloring and translucency of nodes
 *     with materials can be changed using standard cocos2d CCTint and CCFade actions, making
 *     it easier for you to add dynamic coloring effects to your nodes.
 * 
 * CC3Material also supports alpha testing, where the alpha value of each pixel can be
 * tested to determine whether or not it should be drawn. By default, alpha testing is
 * disabled, but alpha testing can sometimes be useful when drawing overlapping objects 
 * each contain transparency and it is not possible to rely only on drawing order and
 * depth testing to mediate whether a pixel should be drawn.
 *
 * Textures are optional. In some cases, if simple solid coloring is to be used, the material
 * may hold no texture at all. This solid coloring will still interact with lighting, creating
 * a realistic surface.
 *
 * More commonly, a material will hold a single instance of CC3Texture in the texture
 * property to provide a simple single-texture surface. This is the most common application
 * of textures to a material.
 *
 * For more sophisticated surfaces, materials also support multi-texturing, where more than
 * one instance of CC3Texture is added to the material using the addTexture: method. Using
 * multi-texturing, these textures can be combined in flexible, customized fashion,
 * permitting sophisticated surface effects.
 *
 * With OpenGL, multi-texturing is processed by a chain of texture units. The material's
 * first texture is processed by the first texture unit (texture unit zero), and subsequent
 * textures held in the material are processed by subsequent texture units, in the order in
 * which the textures were added to the material.
 * 
 * Each texture unit combines its texture with the output of the previous texture unit
 * in the chain. Combining textures is quite flexible under OpenGL, and there are many
 * ways that each texture can be combined with the output of the previous texture unit.
 * The way that a particular texture combines with the previous textures is defined by
 * an instance of CC3TextureUnit, held in the textureUnit property of each texture that
 * was added to the material.
 *
 * For example, to configure a material for bump-mapping, add a texture that contains a
 * normal vector at each pixel instead of a color, and set the textureUnit property of
 * the texture to a CC3BumpMapTextureUnit. You can then combine the output of this
 * bump-mapping with an additional texture that contains the image that will be visible,
 * to provide a detailed 3D bump-mapped surface. To do so, add that second texture to
 * the material, with a texture unit that defines how that addtional texture is to be
 * combined with the output of the bump-mapped texture.
 *
 * The maximum number of texture units is platform dependent, and can be read from
 * [CC3OpenGLESEngine engine].platform.maxTextureUnits.value. This effectively defines
 * how many textures you can add to a material.
 *
 * You'll notice that there are two ways to assign textures to a material: through the
 * texture propety, and through the addTexture: method. The texture property exists for
 * the common case where only one texture is attached to a material. The addTexture:
 * method is used when more than one texture is to be added to the material. However,
 * for the first texture, the two mechanisms are synonomous. The texture property
 * corresponds to the first texture added using the addTexture: method, and for that
 * first texture, you can use either the texture property or the addTexture: method.
 * When multi-texturing, for consistency and simplicity, you would likely just use the
 * addTexture: method for all textures added to the material, including the first texture.
 * 
 * Each CC3MeshNode instance references an instance of CC3Material. Many CC3MeshNode
 * instances may reference the same instance of CC3Material, allowing many objects to
 * be covered by the same material.
 *
 * Once this material has been assigned to a mesh node, changing a texture to a new
 * texture should be performed through the mesh node itself, and not through the
 * material. This is to keep the mesh aligned with the orientation and usable area of
 * the textures since, under iOS, textures are padded to dimensions of a power-of-two
 * (POT), and most texture formats are loaded updside-down.
 *
 * When being drawn, the CC3MeshNode invokes the draw method on the CC3Material
 * instance prior to drawing the associated mesh.
 *
 * When drawing the material to the GL engine, this class remembers which material was
 * last drawn, and only binds the material data to the GL engine when a different material
 * is drawn. This allows the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3Scene
 * so that nodes using the same material are drawn together, before moving on to other
 * materials. This strategy can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine,
 * which improves performance.

 *  - Applies the various lighting and color properties to the GL engine
 *  - Binds the texture property to the GL engine as texture unit zero.

 *  - Disables any unused texture units.
 *
 * If the texture property is nil, and there are no overlays, all texture units
