/** 
 * CC3TextureUnit is used by CC3Texture to configure the GL texture unit to which the
 * texture is being applied. Notably, the texture unit defines how the texture is to
 * be combined with textures from other texture units in a multi-texture layout.
 *
 * With multi-texturing, several textures can be overlaid and combined in interesting
 * ways onto a single material. Each texture is processed by a GL texture unit, and
 * is combined with the textures already processed by other texture units. The source
 * and type of combining operation can be individually configured by subclasses of
 * this class. Support for bump-mapping as one of these combining configurations is
 * explicitly provided by the CC3BumpMapTextureUnit subclass.
 *
 * This base CC3TextureUnit class permits setting a variety of texture environment
 * modes via the textureEnvironmentMode property. For the full range of configuration
 * flexibility, the CC3ConfigurableTextureUnit subclass contains the full range of
 * configuration properties associated with the GL_COMBINE texture environment mode.
