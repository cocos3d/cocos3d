#pragma mark CC3Texture

/** 
 * Each instance of CC3Texture wraps a cocos2d CCTexture2D instance, and manages
 * various texture settings, and applying that texture to the GL engine.
 *
 * To improve both performance and texture quality, by default, instances generate
 * a mipmap of the underlying CCTexture2D when a texture is loaded through this
 * instance. If you do not want mipmaps to be automatically generated, set the
 * class-side shouldGenerateMipmaps property to NO. With automatic mipmap generation
 * turned off, you can selectively generate a mipmap by using the generateMipmap
 * method on any single CC3Texture instance. In addition, textures that contain
 * mipmaps within the file content (PVR files may contain mipmaps) will retain and
 * use this mipmap. See the shouldGenerateMipmaps and hasMipmap properties, and the
 * generateMipmap method for more information.
 *
 * Under iOS, most texture formats are loaded updside-down. This is because the vertical
 * axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative to the iOS view coordinate 
 * system. The isFlippedVerically property can be used to ensure that textures are
 * displayed with the correct orientation. When a CC3Texture is applied to a mesh,
 * the mesh will be adjusted automatically if the texture is vertically flipped.
 *
 * In most cases, a material will hold a single instance of CC3Texture in the texture
 * property to provide a simple single-texture surface. This is the most common application
 * of textures to a material.
 *
 * For more sophisticated surfaces, materials also support multi-texturing, where more than
 * one instance of CC3Texture is added to the material. With multi-texturing, several textures
 * can be combined in flexible, customized fashion, permitting sophisticated surface effects.
 *
 * With OpenGL, multi-texturing is processed by a chain of texture units. The material's
 * first texture is processed by the first texture unit (texture unit zero), and subsequent
 * textures held in the material are processed by subsequent texture units, in the order in
 * which the textures were added to the material.
 * 
 * Each texture unit combines its texture with the output of the previous texture unit
 * in the chain. Combining textures is quite flexible under OpenGL, and there are many
 * ways that each texture can be combined with the output of the previous texture unit.
 * The way that a particular texture combines with the previous textures is defined by
 * an instance of CC3TextureUnit, held in the textureUnit property of each texture that
 * was added to the material.
 *
 * For example, to configure a material for bump-mapping, add a texture that contains a
 * normal vector at each pixel instead of a color, and set the textureUnit property of
 * the texture to a CC3BumpMapTextureUnit. Then add another texture, containing the image
 * that will be visible, to the material. The material will combine these two textures,
 * as specified by the CC3TextureUnit held by the second texture.

 *
 * This property will return NO if this texture was loaded from a PVR texture file,
 * and will return YES if loaded from any other texture file type.
 *
 * For instances of the cluster subclass CC3Texture2D, the value of this property
 * is set to the correct value automatically when the texture file is loaded.
 *
 * For instances of the base cluster parent CCTexture2D, you should set this
 * property to the correct value after loading.
 *
 * If you manually set this property to NO for a CCTexture2D, you should set this property
 * back to YES before clearing this texture from the CCTextureCache, in case the GL engine
 * reuses the texture name again.

 * does not already contain a mipmap and a mipmap has not yet been generated.
 *

 * from file. For instances of the cluster subclass CC3Texture2D, this is tracked automatically,

#pragma mark CC3Texture2D

/**
 * CC3Texture2D is a cluster subclass of CCTexture2D.
 *
 * CC3Texture2D provides more automated tracking of mipmaps and texture orienation.
 * In particular, by instantiating a CC3Texture2D instead of the CCTexture2D superclass:
 *   - The hasMipmap property will correctly indicate the presence of a mipmap
 *     in a texture loaded from a PVR file that already contains a mipmap, so
 *     that a subsequent invocation of generateMipmapIfNeeded will not overwrite
 *     this loaded mipmap, and that loaded mipmap can be used by the CC3Texture
 *     even if the shouldGenerateMipmaps is set to NO.
 *   - The isFlippedVertically property is automatically set to NO when the
 *     instance was loaded from a PVR file, and set to YES otherwise.
 *   - When an instance of CC3Texture2D is deallocated, it automatically sets
 *     the hasMipmap property to NO, and the isFlippedVertically to YES, before
 *     deallocation. This avoids potential confusion if the same texture name
 *     is reused by the GL engine for a CCTexture2D instance.
 *
 * CC3Texture automatically causes an instance of CC3Texture2D to be
 * instantiated by CCTextureCache when the CC3Texture is loaded from a file.
