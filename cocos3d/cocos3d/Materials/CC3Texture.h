/** 
 * Each instance of CC3Texture wraps a CC3GLTexture instance and a CC3TextureUnit instance,
 * and manages applying the texture and texture unit settings to the GL engine.
 *
 * To conserve memory and improve texture loading performance, CC3GLTexture instances are
 * cached, and many CC3Texture instances can share the same underlying CC3GLTexture instance.
 * You can therefore create many CC3Texture instances loaded from the same texture file,
 * without having to worry about the texture contents being loaded multiple times.
 *
 * In most cases, a material will hold a single instance of CC3Texture in the texture property
 * to provide a simple single-texture surface. This is the most common application of textures
 * to a material.
 *
 * For more sophisticated surfaces, materials also support multi-texturing, where more than
 * one instance of CC3Texture is added to the material. With multi-texturing, several textures
 * can be combined in flexible, customized fashion, permitting sophisticated surface effects.
 *
 * With OpenGL, multi-texturing is processed by a chain of texture units. The material's
 * first texture is processed by the first texture unit (texture unit zero), and subsequent
 * textures held in the material are processed by subsequent texture units, in the order in
 * which the textures were added to the material.
 * 
 * Under OpenGL ES 1.1, or OpenGL using a fixed-function pipeline, each texture unit combines
 * its texture with the output of the previous texture unit in the chain. Combining textures
 * is quite flexible under OpenGL, and there are many ways that each texture can be combined
 * with the output of the previous texture unit. The way that a particular texture combines
 * with the previous textures is defined by an instance of CC3TextureUnit, held in the
 * textureUnit property of each texture that was added to the material.
 *
 * For example, to configure a material for bump-mapping, add a texture that contains a
 * normal vector at each pixel instead of a color, and set the textureUnit property of
 * the texture to a CC3BumpMapTextureUnit. Then add another texture, containing the image
 * that will be visible, to the material. The material will combine these two textures,
 * as specified by the CC3TextureUnit held by the second texture.
 *
 * Under OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL with a programmable pipeline, you will generally handle
 * multitexturing in the shader code.
