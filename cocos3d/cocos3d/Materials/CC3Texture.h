/** 
 * The root class of a class cluster representing textures.
 *
 * Since a single texture can be used by many nodes and materials, textures can be cached.
 * The application can use the class-side getTextureNamed: method to retrieve a loaded texture
 * from the cache, and the class-side addTexture: method to add a new texture to the cache.
 * See the notes of those two methods for more details.
 * 
 * When creating an instance, several of the class-side texture... family of methods
 * (particularly those loading from files) automatically check the cache for an existing
 * instance, based on the filename, and will use that cached instance instead of loading
 * the file again. If the texture is not in the cache, these methods will load it and place
 * it in the cache automatically. These methods can therefore be invoked repeatedly without
 * having to be concerned whether multiple copies of the same texture content will be loaded.
 * Check the notes for the creation methods to verify which methods make use of the cache.
 *
 * CC3Texture is the root of a class cluster organized for loading different texture types,
 * for both 2D and cube textures. Use the creation and initialization methods from this root
 * CC3Texture class. The initializer will ensure that the correct subclass for the texture
 * type, and in some cases, the texture file type, is created and returned. Because of this
 * class-cluster structure, be aware that the class of the instance returned by an instance
 * creation or initialization method may be different than the receiver of that method.
 *
 * There is one exception to this paradigm. Under fixed-pipeline rendering, such as in 
 * OpenGL ES 1.1 under iOS, or OpenGL without shaders under OSX, multi-texturing is handled
 * using configurable texture units. In order to assign a texture unit to a CC3Texture, you
 * must directly instatiate an instance of CC3TextureUnitTexture, and then assign a texture
 * unit to it, instead of letting the CC3Texture creation and initialization methods handle it.
 *
 * To improve both performance and texture quality, by default, instances whose width and height
 * are a power-of-two (see the isPOT property) automatically generate a mipmap when a texture is
 * loaded. If you do not want mipmaps to be generated automatically, set the class-side
 * shouldGenerateMipmaps property to NO. With automatic mipmap generation turned off, you can
 * selectively generate a mipmap on any single CC3Texture instance by using the generateMipmap
 * method. In addition, textures that contain mipmaps within the file content (PVR files may contain
 * mipmaps) will retain and use this mipmap. See the shouldGenerateMipmaps and hasMipmap properties,
 * and the generateMipmap method for more information.
 *
 * Under iOS and OSX, most texture formats are loaded updside-down. This is because the vertical
 * axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative to the iOS or OSX view coordinate
 * system. Subclasses that may loaded upside-down can be configured to automatically flip the texture
 * right-way up during loading. In addition, the isFlippedVerically property indicates whether the
 * texture is upside down. This can be used to ensure that textures are displayed with the correct
 * orientation. When a CC3Texture is applied to a mesh, the mesh will be adjusted automatically if
 * the texture is upside down.
 *
 * When building for iOS, raw PNG and TGA images are pre-processed by Xcode to pre-multiply alpha,
 * and to reorder the pixel component byte order, to optimize the image for the iOS platform.
 * If you want to avoid this pre-processing for PNG or TGA files, for textures such as normal maps
 * or lighting maps, that you don't want to be modified, you can prepend a 'p' to the file
 * extension ("ppng" or "ptga") to cause Xcode to skip this pre-processing and to use a loader
 * that does not pre-multiply the alpha. You can also use this for other file types as well.
 * See the notes for the CC3STBImage useForFileExtensions class-side property for more info.

 * than the class of the receiver. You can use the textureClassForFile: method to determine the 
 * cluster subclass whose instance will be returned by this method for the specified file.
 *
 * Normally, you should use the textureFromFile: method to reuse any cached instance instead of
 * creating and loading a new instance. The textureFromFile: method automatically invokes this
 * method if an instance does not exist in the texture cache, in order to create and load the
 * texture from the file, and after doing so, places the newly loaded instance into the cache.

 * can load the texture without first checking the texture cache. The texture can then be placed
 * in the cache using the addTexture: method. If you load two separate textures from the same

/**
 * CC3TextureUnitTexture is a specialized CC3Texture subclass that actually wraps another
 * texture instance and combines it with an instance of a texture unit to define additional
 * environmental configuration information about the use of the texture in multi-texturing
 * under fixed-pipeline rendering used by OpenGL ES 1.1 on iOS, or OpenGL on OSX without shaders.
 *
 * This class is generally not used for multi-texturing under programmable-pipeline rendering
 * used by OpenGL ES 2.0 on, or OpenGL on OSX with shaders, as you will generally handle
 * multitexturing in the shader code. However, it is possible to use an instance of this
 * class with a programmable-pipeline shader if your shader is designed to make use of the
 * texture unit configuration content. This can be used as a mechanism for supporting the
 * same multi-texturing configuration between both fixed and programmable pipelines.
 *
 * You instantiate an instance of CC3TextureUnitTexture directly, using any of the instance
 * creation or initializaton methods defined by the CC3Texture superclass. Or, if you already
 * have an instance of a CC3Texture, you can wrap it in an instance of CC3TextureUnitTexture
 * by using the textureWithTexture: or initWithTexture: creation and initialization methods
 * of this class.
 *
 * You can then create an instance of CC3TextureUnit, configure it appropriately, and set it
 * into the textureUnit property of your CC3TextureUnitTexture instance. By adding multiple
 * CC3TextureUnitTexture instances to your CC3Material, you can combine textures creatively.
 *
 * For example, to configure a material for bump-mapping, add a texture that contains a
 * normal vector at each pixel instead of a color, and set the textureUnit property of
 * the texture to a CC3BumpMapTextureUnit. Then add another texture, containing the image
 * that will be visible, to the material. The material will combine these two textures,
 * as specified by the CC3TextureUnit held by the second texture.
