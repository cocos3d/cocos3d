 * Relative to mesh particles, point particles are extremely efficient and performance-friendly,
 * since they comprise only a single vertex per particle, and do not need to be transformed.
 * However, they are limited in that they can comprise only a single rectangular 2D texture.
 *
 * Point particles can be located, colored, and textured. Point particles cannot be rotated
 * or given a 3D appearance. Point particles do not support a texture rectangle, and so all

 * vertexColors, and vertexPointSizes arrays..
 *
 * Since only one vertex is used per point particle, and that data is usually updated frequently
 * by the application, there is little advantage to using indices during drawing. In general,

/**
 * Indicates the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Each vertex can contain several types of content, optionally including location, normal,
 * color, and point size. To identify this various content, this property is a bitwise-OR
 * of flags that enumerate the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Valid component flags of this property include:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize
 *
 * To indicate that this mesh should contain particular vertex content, construct a bitwise-OR
 * combination of one or more of the component types listed above, and set this property to that
 * combined value.
 *
 * Setting each bitwise-OR component in this property instructs this instance to
 * automatically construct the appropriate type of contained vertex array:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation - automatically constructs a CC3VertexLocations instance in the
 *     vertexLocations property, that holds 3D vertex locations, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *     This component is optional, as the vertexLocations property will be constructed regardless.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal - automatically constructs a CC3VertexNormals instance in the
 *     vertexNormals property, that holds 3D vertex normals, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor - automatically constructs a CC3VertexColors instance in the vertexColors
 *     property, that holds RGBA colors with GLubyte components, in one ccColor4B structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize - automatically constructs a CC3VertexPointSizes
 *     instance in the vertexPointSizes property, that holds one GLfloat per vertex.
 * 
 * This property is a convenience property. Instead of using this property, you can create the
 * appropriate vertex arrays in those properties directly.
 * 
 * The vertex arrays constructed by this property will be configured to use interleaved data
 * if the shouldInterleaveVertices property is set to YES. You should ensure the value of the
 * shouldInterleaveVertices property to the desired value before setting the value of this property.
 * The initial value of the shouldInterleaveVertices property is YES.
 *
 * If the content is interleaved, for each vertex, the content is held in the structures identified in
 * the list above, in the order that they appear in the list. You can use this consistent organization
 * to create an enclosing structure to access all data for a single vertex, if it makes it easier to
 * access vertex data that way. If vertex content is not specified, it is simply absent, and the content
 * from the following type will be concatenated directly to the content from the previous type.
 *
 * For instance, if color content is not required, you would omit the kCC3VertexContentColor value
 * when setting this property, and the resulting structure for each vertex would be a location
 * CC3Vector, followed by a normal CC3Vector, followed immediately by a point size GLfloat.
 * You can then define an enclosing structure to hold and manage all content for a single vertex.
 *
 * The vertex arrays created by this property cover the most common use cases and data formats.
 * If you require more customized vertex arrays, you can use this property to create the typical
 * vertex arrays, and then customize them, by accessing the vertex arrays individually through
 * their respective properties. After doing so, if the vertex data is interleaved, you should
 * invoke the updateVertexStride method on this instance to automatically align the elementOffset
 * and vertexStride properties of all of the contained vertex arrays. After setting this property,
 * you do not need to invoke the updateVertexStride method unless you subsequently make changes
 * to the constructed vertex arrays.
 *
 * It is safe to set this property more than once. Doing so will remove any existing vertex arrays
 * and replace them with those indicated by this property.
 * 
 * When reading this property, the appropriate bitwise-OR values are returned, corresponding to the
 * contained vertex arrays, even if those arrays were constructed directly, instead of by setting
 * this property. If this mesh contains no vertex arrays, this property will return kCC3VertexContentNone.

 * For CC3PointParticleEmitter, the initial value of the shouldDisableDepthMask property
