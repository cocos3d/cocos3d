/**
 * CC3ParticleProtocol represents a single particle emitted by a CC3ParticleEmitter particle emitter.
 *
 * When creating a particle system, you write application-specific implementation of CC3ParticleProtocol
 * to embody the state and life-cycle behaviour of each particle. You do not always need to create a
 * customized subclass of CC3ParticleEmitter.
 * 
 * To implement a specific particle system, create an implementation of CC3ParticleProtocol, and override
 * the initializeParticle and updateBeforeTransform: methods (and possibly the updateAfterTransform:
 * method) to define the initial state, and life-cycle behaviour of the particle.
 *
 * Particles can be added to an emitter by the application directly, or can be created and emitted
 * from the emitter automatically, based on configuration within the emitter. In both cases, the
 * interaction on the particle is the same.
 *
 * When a particle starts its life, the emitter will automatically invoke the initializeParticle
 * method on the particle.
 *
 * Then, during the life-cycle of a particle, the emitter will periodically update the particle by
 * invoking the updateBeforeTransform: and updateAfterTransform: callback methods. These method
 * invocations include the time interval since the last update, so that the particle can emulate
 * realistic real-time behaviour.
 *
 * Be aware that, in the interests of performance and memory conservation, expired particles may be
 * cached and reused, and particle emission may not always involve instantiating a new instance of
 * your CC3ParticleProtocol implementation class.
 *
 * With this in mind, you should not depend on init method being invoked during particle emission.
 * All code that establishes the initial emitted state of a particle should be included in the
 * initializeParticle method.
 *
 * From within the initializeParticle, updateBeforeTransform: and updateAfterTransform methods,
 * the particle has access to the emitter (and the node hierarchy and scene it sits in) through
 * the emitter property. In addition, the particle can read and manipulate its own drawable content. 
 *
 * Beyond these basic drawable content properties, when you create in implementation of
 * CC3ParticleProtocol, you should add any other content that is needed to determine the behaviour
 * of your particle. For example, you might include a velocity property for particles that are
 * following a path (or even a path object to define that path more explicitly), and a timeToLive
 * property, for particles that have a finite lifespan. There are several protocol extensions,
 * such as CC3MortalParticleProtocol and CC3UniformlyMovingParticleProtocol that provide standard
 * definitions of basic additional functionality in this respect.
 *
 * It is up to the particle to determine when it expires. Some particles may never expire.
 * Others may keep track of their life or path and expire at a certain time or place.
 *
 * Once your custom particle has detemined that it has expired, in the updateBeforeTransform: or
 * updateAfterTransform method, you can set the isAlive property of the particle to NO. When either
 * of those methods returns, the emitter will then automatically remove the particle (and set it
 * aside for possible reuse). Expired particles are not drawn and do not receive further
 * updateBeforeTransform: or updateAfterTransform: callback method invocations.
 *
 * You can also set the isAlive property to NO in the initializeParticle method
 * to cause the emission of the particle to be aborted.

 * can change any of the particle state prior to it being emitted. You can also set the isAlive
 * property of the particle to NO to cause the addition or emission of the particle to be aborted.
 *
 * When this method is invoked, the particle may have just been instantiated, or it may be an
 * older expired particle that is being reused. With this in mind, this method should include
 * all code that establishes the initial state of a particle. You should not rely on any state
 * set in the init method of the particle.
 * 
 * If you have subclassed another class that implements the CC3ParticleProtocol protocol, you should

/**
 * A CC3MeshNode that emits 3D particles.
 *
 * Particles are small, simple objects that can each have their own location, movement,
 * color, and lifetime. They are used where many simple and similar objects are needed.
 * Examples might include confetti, stars, tiles, bricks, etc.
 *
 * One key way that particles differ from mesh nodes is that all vertices for all of the particles
 * managed by an emitter are submitted to the GL engine in a single draw call. This is much more
 * efficient than each mesh making its own GL call, and for large numbers of small objects, this
 * technique dramatically improves performance.
 *
 * Particles can be added to an emitter directly, using the emitParticle: method, can be created
 * and emitted from the emitter manually, using the emitParticle and emitParticles: method, or
 * can be emitted automatically at a pre-determined rate from the emitter by setting the emission
 * properties of the emitter.
 
 * Typically, particles are automatically created and emitted by the emitter at some predetermined
 * rate and pattern, such as a fountain, fire, hose, etc. and follow a pre-determined algorithmic
 * path with a finite life span.
 *
 * Alternately, particles can be added to the emitter by the application directly, with the emitter
 * containing and managing the particles, but leaving the application in control of particle control
 * and interaction. In this use case, the emitter acts as a mesh batching system, allowing the meshes
 * from a large number of distinct objects to be submitted to the GL engine in a single draw call.
 * For example, the application may want to create a large number of bricks, tiles, plants, etc.,
 * and have them efficiently managed and rendered by an emitter.
 *
 * All particles added to or emitted by this emitter will be covered by the same material, and optional
 * texture, as determined by the material and texture properties of this emitter node. But each particle
 * may have its own location, movement, orientation, normals, and colors.
 *
 * Although all particles are covered by the same material and texture, if the vertexContentTypes
 * property of this emitter is configured with the kCC3VertexContentColor component, then each
 * particle can be assigned a different color. And for particles that support texture mapping,
 * such as mesh particles, then each particle can be covered by a different section of the
 * texture assigned to the emitter, effectivly allowing each particle to be textured differently.
 *
 * Particles managed by a CC3ParticleEmitter live in the 3D scene, as distinct from the 2D
 * particles available through the cocos2d CCParticleSystem class.
 * 
 * For many particle effects, 2D is sufficient, and can be quite effective. You can use a cocos2d
 * CCParticleSystem instance with a CC3Billboard, to embed 2D particle systems within a 3D cocos3d scene.
 *
 * However, for applications that need particles to move in three dimensions, you can use this class,
 * or one of its specialized subclasses. Each particle emitted by this emitter has a 3D location,
 * and can appear in front of or behind other 3D objects, depending on relative distance from the camera.
 *
 * A particle system embodies three classes working together to emit and control particles.
 *   -# The emitter is responsible for generating and managing particles of a particular type.
 *      Particles that have expired can be reused, reinitialized and re-emitted by the emitter.
 *      Typically, you will use one of the standard emitters.
 *   -# The navigator is attached to the emitter and configures the lifetime and path of the
 *      particle. You can use one of the standard navigators, but you will often write your
 *      own navigator to provide more interesting emission characterstics and finer control
 *      of how each particle is configured.
 *   -# The particle itself is responsible for executing the behaviour and motion of the particle
 *      throughout its lifespan. You will generally always write your own particle subclass.
 *
 * When a particle is added or emitted, all three of these objects get a chance to initialize
 * and configure the particle. Typically, the emitter is responsible for instanitating a new
 * particle, or arranging to reuse an expired particle. The navigator initializes the lifetime
 * and path configuration information within the particle, or the particle itself can do so
 * during its own initialization. During this process, the emitter invokes the initializeParticle:
 * method on itself and the navigator, and then the initializeParticle method on the particle.
 *
 * The isAlive property is automatically set to YES before the initializeParticle method is
 * invoked on the particle, so you don't have to set it there. You can, however, set it to
 * NO during execution of the initializeParticle method, to abort the emission of that particle.
 *
 * Subsequently, on each update pass, the emitter will automatically invoke the updateBeforeTransform:
 * method (and optionally the updateAfterTransform: method) on the particle. You will override this
 * method to define the behaviour of your particles over time. If your particles have a finite lifespan,
 * you can indicate that a particle has expired by having the particle set its own isAlive property
 * to NO within the updateBeforeTransform: (or updateAfterTransform:) method. The emitte will then
 * arrange to remove the particle and set it aside for future reuse.
 *
 * To enhance performance and memory, particles that have expired are retained and reused as further
 * particles are emitted. This is transparent to the particles (and the developer), as the reused
 * particle follow the same initialize/update life-cycle described above. The isAlive property is
 * reset to YES, and the initializeParticle: methods of the emitter and navigator, and the
 * initializeParticle method of the particle are invoked when the particle is reused and emitted again.
 *
 * Like all mesh nodes, the emitter contains a CC3Material instance that determines how the particle
 * content will blend with content from other 3D objects that overlap this emitter, and to specify
 * the texture that covers the particles.
 *
 * You can indicate the rate at which particle are emitted by setting either of the emissionRate
 * or emissionInterval properties. You can set for how long the emitter should emit particles
 * using the emissionDuration property.
 *
 * For emitters with finite emissionDuration, you can set the shouldRemoveOnFinish to YES to
 * indicate that the emitter should remove itself automatically from the 3D scene, once all
 * particles have expired, cleaning up all memory usage by the emitter and particles along the
 * way. This features allows you to set a transient particle generator, such as an explosion,
 * going and then forget about it.
 *
 * By default, the boundingVolume of the emitter will automatically be recalculated every time
 * a particle moves. Although this is convenient and ensures accuracy, recalculating the bounding
 * volume can often be an expensive operation. To avoid this, you can manually set static boundaries
 * in the boundingVolume of this emitter node and then set the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume property
 * of this emitter to YES to indicate that you don't want the emitter to recalculate its
 * boundingVolume on each update.
 *
 * During development, you can verify the size of this static bounding volume your settings by
 * setting the shouldDrawBoundingVolume property to YES to make the bounding volume visible to
 * ensure that the bounding volume is sized appropriately to contain all the particles, without
 * being overly expansive.
 *
 * You may be wondering how to determine the correct static bounding volume properties. You can do
 * this at development time by setting the shouldMaximize property of the boundingVolume of this
 * emitter to YES, and setting the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume property of this emitter to NO, so
 * that the boundingVolume will be recalculated on each update. After the emitter has finished,
 * output the boundingVolume to the log using LogDebug to record the maximume size that the bounding
 * volume grew to during particle emission. This will give you an idea of how big to set the static
 * boundary properties of the boundingVolume of your emitter.
 *
 * All memory used by the particles and the underlying vertex mesh is managed by this
 * emitter node, and is deallocated automatically when the emitter is released.

#pragma mark Emitting particles

/**
 * Emits a single particle of the type specified in the particleClass property.
 *
 * Each particle is initialized prior to emission. A particle can be initialized in any of the
 * initializeParticle: method of the emitter, the initializeParticle: method of the particle
 * navigator, or the initializeParticle method of the particle itself. Each particle system has
 * different needs. To initialize each particle, you should override a combination of these
 * methods, as appropriate to initialize the particles.
 *
 * For particles that follow a planned life-cycle and trajectory, the initializeParticle: method
 * of the particle navigator is the appropriate place to initialize the life-cycle and trajectory
 * of the particle. For particles that are more self-aware and self-determining, the initializeParticle
 * method of the particle itself may be the best place to initialized the particle.
 *
 * If the emitter is set to emit particles automatically, by setting an emissionRate or
 * emissionInterval, and then invoking play, you do not need to invoke this method directly.
 * It will be invoked automatically when it is time to emit a particle. This is the most
 * common situation, and so in most cases, you will never invoke this method directly.
 *
 * However, there are some situations where the application might want more control over the
 * creation or configuration of particles. One example might be if you want to create a quantity
 * of fixed particles, such as a chain, or lights on a tree, that are not emitted at a steady
 * rate. Another example might be that you want to be able to configure or track each particle
 * from the application code, once it has been created, emitted, and returned from this method.
 *
 * In these situations, you can avoid invoking play (and avoid setting the isEmitting flag set
 * to YES), and then invoke the emitParticle method whenever you want to create a new particle.
 * 
 * This method returns the emitted particle. If the maximum capacity has been reached, as
 * defined by the maximumParticleCapacity property, or if the particle itself aborts the
 * emission by setting the isAlive property to NO in the initializeParticle method of the
 * particle, this method will return nil.
 *
 * You may also use the emitParticle: method to create partiles outside of the emitter and add
 * them to the emitter. You can use that emitParticle: method instead of this method when you
 * want to select different particle classes. This emitParticle class will always emit a
 * particle of the class defined by the particleClass property.

/**
 * Adds the specified particle to the emitter and emits it.

 * instead of having the emitter instantiate and intialize them.
 *
 * This method is particularly useful when the application wants to create and emit a particle
 * of a class other than the class indicated by the particleClass method. In doing so, the
 * application must adhere to the requirement that the particle must implement the protocols
 * specified by the requiredParticleProtocol property of both this emitter and the particle
 * navigator. Submitting a particle to this method that does not implement both of these
 * required protocols will raise an assertion exception.
 *
 * This method is also useful when the application does not want particles to be automatically
 * emitted, but wants the emitter to efficiently manage and render a large number of particles
 * created by the application. For example, the application may want to create and manage a large
 * number of bricks, tiles, plants, swarms, etc.
 * 
 * Particles added by this method follow exactly the same initialization and update process as
 * particles that are emitted by this emitter. As with each emitted particle, for each particle
 * added using this method the initializeParticle: method is invoked on each of the emitter and
 * navigator in turn, and then the initializeParticle method is invoked on the particle itself.
 * 
 * There are only two differences between the emitParticle and emitParticle: methods:
 *   - The emitParticle method will reuse an expired particle if one is available. The emitParticle:
 *     method accepts a new particle instance on each invocation.
 *   - The emitParticle method automatically instantiates particles of the class indicated
 *     by the particleClass property. The emitParticle: method allows the application to instantiate
 *     a particle of any class that implements the protocols defined by the requiredParticleProtocol
 *     property of both this emitter and the particle navigator.
 * 
 * You may combine use of the emitParticle method and the emitParticle: method. You may also combine use
 * of automatic emission (by configuring an emission schedule within this emitter and then invoking the
 * play method), and manual emission using a combination of the emitParticle and emitParticle: methods.
 *
 * When using a combination of emission techniques, particles added by this method are eligible
 * to be reused automatically by the emitter once they have expired.
 *
 * When initializing particles outside of the emitter prior to invoking this method, be sure that
 * the emitter property of the particle is set to nil when submitting the particle to this method,

 *

 * by setting particle properties such as the location, direction, and speed of the particle.
 * This separation of responsibilities often means that a single navigator class can be used to
 * direct any type of particle.
 *
 * For example, a particle navigator designed to emit partiles in the the shape of a fountain could
 * be used to create a fountain of point particles, a fountain of mesh particles, or a fountain of
 * some other class of particles that supported the protocol required by the navigator.
 *
 * Similarly, a navigator designed to lay particles out on a grid, or sprinkle stars across the
 * sky could do so with point particles or mesh particles.
 * 
 * The particle navigator is only involved in the initialization of the particle. It does not
 * interact with the particle once it has been emitted.
