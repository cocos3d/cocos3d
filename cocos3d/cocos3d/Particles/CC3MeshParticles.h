 *
 * Each mesh particle is comprised of an individual mesh. Like any mesh, a mesh particle
 * represents a true 3D object that can have length, width and depth, can be moved, rotated
 * and scaled, and can be colored and covered with a texture.
 *
 * Each mesh particle uses a CC3VertexArrayMesh as a template. But, because it is a particle,
 * this basic mesh template is copied into the mesh arrays of the CC3MeshParticleEmitter, where
 * it is merged with the meshes of the other particles managed by the emitter, and is submitted
 * to the GL engine in a single draw call.
 *
 * Like mesh nodes, mesh particles may be transformed (moved, rotated & scaled). However, unlike
 * mesh nodes, the vertices of a mesh particle are transformed by the CPU in application memory,
 * and the transformed vertices are drawn without further individual transformation by the GPU.
 *
 * Mesh particles are transformed by the emitter through the transformVertices method on the particle.
 * This method is invoked automatically by the emitter when a particle has been changed, and the mesh
 * particle implementation defines what type of transform occurs when this method is invoked.
 *
 * This creates a trade-off, where, relative to mesh nodes, the GPU rendering performance is
 * dramatically improved for large numbers of mesh particles, but the CPU load is increased
 * when mesh particles are constantly being transformed, particularly for larger meshes.
 *
 * Relative to mesh nodes, mesh particles work best when there are many small meshes that are

 *
 * Setting this property to NO will stop the particles from being transformed when the bounding
 * volume of the emitter does not intersect the frustum of the camera, improving application
 * performance when the particles are offscreen. Particles will still be updated, but their
 * vertices will not be transformed until the emitter comes within the view of the camera.
 *
 * Care should be taken when setting this property to NO, because the bounding volume of an emitter
 * is calculated from the current vertices of the particles. When the particles stop being transformed,
 * under the action of this property, the bounding volume will stop being updated. Since the particles
 * are still updated even when not visible, this can cause a jarring visual effect when the emitter
 * comes back into view of the camera and the particles may seem to jump unexpectedly into space that
 * was not part of the emitter bounding volume when it previously stopped being updated. If such an
 * effect occurs and is undesirable, this property can be left set to YES so that particles will
 * continue to be transformed even when outside the view of the camera.
 *
 * When the bounding volume of the emitter is fixed, as indicated by the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume
 * property, it is assumed that the bounding volume has already been sized to encompass all possible
 * paths of the particles. As a result, when this emitter uses a fixed bounding volume, the particles
 * are never transformed when that bounding volume is outside the view of the camera. Therefore, when

 * the vertices are rotated using the rotation applied to this particle.

 * method to update the colors of the individual vertices of this particle if individual particle and
 * vertex colors are supported by the emitter.
