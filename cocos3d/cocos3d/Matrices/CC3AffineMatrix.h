/**
 * CC3AffineMatrix is a 4x3 matrix that can represent affine transforms such as rotation,
 * scaling, reflection, shearing, and translation.
 *
 * Affine matrices differ from linear matrices in that affine matrices can perform
 * translation transformations.
 *
 * Internally, the dimensions of this matrix are four columns by three rows. Data is held in a
 * CC3Matrix4x3 structure of 12 GLfloat elements in column-major order. For situations requiring
 * only 3D affine transformations, this offers a storage savings over using a full 4x4 matrix.
 *
 * Although this matrix has only three rows, it behaves like a square matrix with four columns
 * and four rows, with the missing row always taken to contain (0, 0, 0, 1). Since all affine
 * transforms never change this last row, the requirement to store this last row is dropped in
 * order to reduce memory and calculation overhead. Where operations require this last row to
 * be present, it is temporarily generated automatically.

/**

 *
 * Since the affine matrix does not store the fourth row, transposing an affine matrix will
 * result in the contents of the fourth column being lost. After the transposition, the
 * contents of both the forth column and the (implied) fourth row will contain (0,0,0,1).
 * 
 * If this is not the desired result, use the contents of this matrix to populate either an instance
 * of CC3ProjectionMatrix, or a CC3Matrix4x4 structure, and take the transpose of that matrix.
