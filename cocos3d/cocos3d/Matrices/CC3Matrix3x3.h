 *
 * Although CC3Matrix3x3 has the same internal structure as GLKMatrix3, the structures may
 * have different byte alignment requirements. Avoid casting directly between GLKMatrix3
 * and CC3Matrix3x3, as this is not guaranteed to work reliably. Instead, use the functions
 * CC3Matrix3x3PopulateFromGLKMatrix3 and GLKMatrix3PopulateFromCC3Matrix3x3 to convert 
 * between the two structures.
 *
 * You can, however, reliably copy an array of GLKMatrix3s to an array of CC3Matrix3x3s, 
 * and vice-versa, by simply using memcpy, or equivalent memory copying function. This is
 * also true of single CC3Matrix3x3 and GLKMatrix3 structures. Copying is successful because
 * the array or pointer declarations will ensure the respective byte-alignment requirements, 
 * and since the internal structures are identical, the contents of the copy will be identical.
