/**
 * CC3LinearMatrix is a 3x3 matrix that can represent 3D linear transforms such as rotation,
 * scaling, reflection and shearing. Matrices of this class cannot represent 3D translation.
 *
 * Internally, the dimensions of this matrix are three columns by three rows. Data is held in a
 * CC3Matrix3x3 structure of 9 GLfloat elements in column-major order. For situations requiring
 * only 3D linear transformations, this offers a storage savings over using a full 4x4 matrix.

 * This transform works in the direction from model-space to view-space, and therefore includes an
 * implied inversion relative to the directToward:withUp: method. When applied to the camera, this
 * has the effect of locating the camera at the eyeLocation and pointing it at the targetLocation,
 * while orienting it so that 'up' appears to be in the upDirection, from the viewer's perspective.
 * 
 * Since linear matrices are unaffected by translation, this matrix will be populated to look in
 * the correct direction as if the eye were at the specified coordinate, but will not be looking
 * at the target location, as the matrix cannot be translated to the location of the eye. In order
 * to bring the targetLocation into view, this matrix must be applied to a matrix that can support
 * translation to the eyeLocation.
