/**
 * CC3ProjectionMatrix is a 4x4 matrix that can represent many non-linear 3D transforms,
 * including perspective projection and orthographic projection.
 *
 * Although its primary intended use is to act as a projection matrix for the 3D camera (hence its
 * name), as a full 4x4 matrix, a number of other non-linear transforms may be created with this class.
 *
 * Internally, the dimensions of this matrix are four columns by four rows. Data is held
 * in a CC3Matrix4x4 structure of 16 GLfloat elements in column-major order.
