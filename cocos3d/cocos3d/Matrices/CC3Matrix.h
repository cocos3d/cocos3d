/**
 * CC3Matrix is the abstract base class for a mathematical matrix.
 *
 * Subclasses provide concrete implementations for a variety of matrix sizes and operations.
 * Providing a variety of matrix subclasses allows the size (and hence storage requirments)
 * of the matrix to be selected appropriately for each situation.
 *
 * All matrix functionaly is defined by this base class, and you can use this base class in
 * declarations, and then instantiate the appropriate subclass, depending on operational needs.
 *
 * Where a particular operation is not applicable to a subclass, the interface declaration for that
 * subclass will make note of the limitation. Depending on the nature of the operation, the subclass
 * may choose to silently ignore the request (eg- attempting to translate a linear matrix), will
 * provide limited functionality (eg- transposing an affine matrix), or, where the missing functionaly
 * might cause confusing or unpredictable results, will raise an assertion exception (eg- attempting
 * to apply a perspective projection to a linear or affine matrix).
