/**
 * CC3OpenGLESEngine manages the state of the OpenGL ES engine.
 *
 * OpenGL ES is designed to be a state machine that operates
 * asynchronously from the application code that calls its functions.
 * Calls to most gl* functions queue up commands to the GL engine that
 * are processed by the GL engine asynchronously from the gl* call.
 *
 * This design allows GL command execution to be run on a different
 * processor than the application is running on, specifically a
 * hardware-assisted GPU.
 *
 * To maximize the throughput and performance of this design, it is
 * important that GL state is changed only when necessary, and that
 * querying of the GL state machine is avoided wherever possible.
 * 
 * By routing all GL requests through CC3OpenGLESEngine, this class
 * can keep track of the GL state change requests made to the GL engine,
 * and will only forward such requests to the GL engine if the state
 * really is changing.
 *
 * OpenGL defines many functions and state change options. The overall GL
 * functionality covered by CC3OpenGLESEngine is broken down into the
 * major areas of interest, and each of these areas is managed by a
 * separate tracking manager. Each of these tracking managers is available
 * through a specific property on this CC3OpenGLESEngine class.
 *
 * To allow this state tracking to be available and consistently tracked 
 * across the complete application, CC3OpenGLESEngine is implemented as
 * a singleton design pattern. You can access the singleton instance by
 * invoking [CC3OpenGLESEngine engine] anywhere in your application code.
 *
 * The two methods open and close define a scope context under which
 * tracking will occur. Once the open method is called, for state tracking
 * to work, ALL OpenGL ES calls that are tracked by the engine MUST be
 * directed through it, until the matching close method is invoked.
 *
 * The open method is invoked by the CC3Scene instance when 3D drawing
 * begins, and the close method is invoked by the CC3Scene instance when
 * 3D drawing ends.
 *
 * If your application requires access to OpenGL ES state or functionality
 * that is not covered by the trackers attached to this engine, you can add
 * that functionality in one of two ways:
 *   -# Create a subclass of one of the attached tracker managers, add the
 *      additional state trackers to that subclass, and replace the existing
 *      tracker manager with your enhanced subclass in the appropriate property
 *      of the CC3OpenGLESEngine singleton.
 *   -# Create a new subclass of CC3OpenGLESStateTrackerManager, add the 
 *      additional state trackers to that subclass, and set your enhanced
 *      CC3OpenGLESStateTrackerManager into the appExtensions property,
 *      which is nil, unless your application sets a tracker manager there.
