/**
 * If your application supports BOTH multisampling AND node-picking from touch events,
 * you should use this class instead of EAGLView.
 *
 * The multisampling framebuffer used when multisampling antialiasing is active interferes
 * with node-picking from touch events, because the multisampling framebuffer does not support
 * the pixel reading operation required by the node-picking algorithm.
 *
 * This subclass adds support for node-picking while multisampling is active by adding an
 * additional framebuffer that links the existing resolve color buffer to a newly created
 * depth buffer. Rendering during node picking is directed to this specialized framebuffer,
 * which does support pixel reading, by invoking the openPicking method. Once node-picking
 * is complete, the multisampling framebuffer can be made active again for normal rendering
 * operations by invoking the closePicking method.
 *
 * The additional depth and frame buffers are only added if BOTH multisampling is active and
 * node-picking is being used. To preserve memory, the additional buffers will not be created
 * unless both multisampling and node-picking are active.
 *
 * The heavy lifting of this mechanism is handled by a specialized CC3ES1Renderer, which this
 * class creates and wraps.
