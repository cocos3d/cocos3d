/**
 * The mesh node used to build a shadow volume. A single CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode
 * instance represents the shadow from a single light for a single shadow-casting node.
 *
 * As a mesh node, the CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode instance is added as a child to the node
 * whose shadow is to be represented. To automatically create a CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode
 * and add it to the shadow-casting node, use the addShadowVolumesForLight: method on
 * the shadow-casting node (or any structural ancestor of that node).
 *
 * CC3ShadowVolumeMeshNode implements the CC3ShadowProtocol. The implementation of the
 * updateShadow method populates a shadow volume mesh that encompasses the volume of
 * space shadowed by the shadow-casting node. Any other object with this shadow volume
 * will be shadowed by that node.
 *
 * The shadow volume mesh of this node is invisible in itself, but by depth-testing
 * against other drawn nodes, a stencil is created indicating which view pixels will
 * be in shadow. Those view pixels are then darkened accordingly.
 *
 * Of all shadowing techniques, shadow volumes result in the most accurate shadows,
 * but are also the most computationally intensive.
 *
 * Shadow volumes use a stencil buffer to determine the areas that require shading. The stencil
 * buffer must be allocated within the EAGLView when the view is created and initialized. Under
 * iOS, the sencil buffer is combined with the depth buffer, and you create a stencil buffer by
 * passing the value GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8 as the depth format argument in the CCGLView method
 * viewWithFrame:pixelFormat:depthFormat:preserveBackbuffer:sharegroup:multiSampling:numberOfSamples:.

/**
 * Adds a shadow volume to each descendant node that contains a mesh, for the specified light.
 * By using this method, you can control which lights cast shadows for each mesh node in your scene.
 *
 * A shadow volume is a special child mesh node added to each descendant mesh node. The effect
 * is to have each descendant mesh cast a shadow from the specified light. Invoking this method
 * on the CC3Scene will cause all meshes in the scene to cast shadows from the specified light.
 *
 * These shadow volume meshes are invisible, but are used to populate a stencil buffer that keeps
 * track of where a shadow volume mesh intersects a visible object mesh. This stencil is used to
 * paint the shadows onto the scene.
 *
 * The shadow volume created by this method will only have effect if the visible property of both
 * the node and the light are set to YES (ie- turning off a light also turns off any shadows it
 * is casting).
 *
 * Shadow volumes use a stencil buffer to determine the areas that require shading. The stencil
 * buffer must be allocated within the EAGLView when the view is created and initialized.
 * On the iOS, the sencil buffer is combined with the depth buffer. You create a stencil buffer
 * by passing the value GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8 as the depth format argument in the CCGLView method
 * viewWithFrame:pixelFormat:depthFormat:preserveBackbuffer:sharegroup:multiSampling:numberOfSamples:.
 *
 * It is safe to invoke this method more than once with the same, or a different light. Only one
 * shadow volume will be added to any mesh node for a particular light. Each mesh node checks to
 * see if a shadow volume has been added already, and will not add a second shadow volume for the
 * same light.
 *
 * To ensure that all objects behind each shadow-casting mesh node are shadowed, each shadow
 * volume mesh extends to infinity. As a result, when a shadow volum is added using this method,
 * the hasInfiniteDepthOfField property of the active camera is automatically set to YES, so that
 * the shadow volume is not clipped by the far clipping plane of the camera's frustum.
 *
 * If you know that you will never require end-caps, and want a finite camera frustum, you
 * can set the hasInfiniteDepthOfField of the active camera back to NO. See the notes for
 * the shouldAddShadowVolumeEndCapsOnlyWhenNeeded property for more info on the use of shadow
 * volume end caps.
 *
 * Shadows are inherently dynamic, and change as the shadow-casting node and light move relative
 * to one another. For this reason, this method causes all meshes with a shadow volume to retain
 * vertex location and index data (and for skinned meshes vertex weight and matrix index data).
 *
 * If you know that the mesh nodes and light are fixed, after the first update to the scene,
 * you can save memory by retrieving the vertex locations, indices, weights and matrix indices
 * vertex arrays, set the shouldReleaseRedundantContent property on each to YES, and invoke the
 * releaseRedundantContent method on each.
 *
 * The internal management of shadow volumes requires intense access to the faces of the mesh
 * that is casting the shadow. For this reason, when a shadow volume is added to a mesh node, the
 * shouldCacheFaces property of that node is automatically set to YES, to improve the performance
 * of shadow volume calculations. If you prefer to preserve memory instead, you can explicitly set
 * this property back to NO.
 *
 * This method will affect only the current descendant mesh nodes. Descendants added after this
 * method is invoked will not automatically cast shadows. When dynamically adding a descendant
 * node, invoke this method to have the new node cast a shadow from the specified light.
 *
 * When a light is removed from the scene, the shadow volume for that light will automatically
 * be removed from each mesh node. However, when a light is added, shadow volumes will not
 * automatically be created for that light. When dyamically adding a light, you should invoke
 * this method, or the addShadowVolumes method, to create a shadow volume for that light.

/**
 * The vertices of a shadow volume start at the vertices of the light terminator of the

 * short distance to offset the shadow volume vertices from the corresponding vertices
 * of the shadow-casting node, in the direction away from the light.
 *
 * The purpose of nudging the vertices of the shadow volume away from the shadow-casting
 * mesh is to reduce Z-fighting between the shadow-caster mesh and the shadow volume
 * mesh. In this sense, this property aims to fix the same issue that the shadowOffsetUnits
 * and shadowOffsetFactor properties attempt to resolve.
 *
 * The difference is that the shadowVolumeVertexOffsetFactor is always applied in
 * the direction away from the <em>light</em>, whereas the shadowOffsetUnits and
 * shadowOffsetFactor properties move the depth testing towards or away from the
 * <em>camera</em>. This difference can sometimes show up as the relative positions
 * of the shadow-caster, light and camera move around, and is particularly apparent
 * with 2D planar meshes.
 * 
 * Particularly with 2D planar meshes, you can set this property to a positive, non-zero
 * value to nudge the shadow volume vertices away from the shadow-caster vertices in the
 * direction away from the light.
 *
 * Although both this property and the shadowOffsetUnits and shadowOffsetFactor properties
 * can be used together, doing so can introduce conflicts, again depending on the relative
 * positions of the shadow-casting node, light and camera. It is recommended that you use
 * one or the other technique. Either set one or both of the shadowOffsetUnits and
 * shadowOffsetFactor properties to a non-zero value, and leave this property with a zero
 * value, or set this property to a non-zero value, and set the shadowOffsetUnits and

 *
 * For non-planar convex meshes, leave this property set to zero. For planar meshes,
 * set this property to a positive non-zero value, and set the shadowOffsetUnits and
 * shadowOffsetFactor properties to zero.

/**
 * The calculation of shadow shape and movement can often be quite expensive. To keep
 * performance high, these calculations are performed only when necessary, specifically
 * when any of the shadow-casting node, light or camera moves.
 *
 * Because of this design, few updates will be required for a relatively static
 * environment where the light, camera, and node do not often move. In such a situation,
 * the processing load added by the shadow calculations will be low.
 * 
 * However, when the node, light and camera are in constant motion, a noticable performance
 * penalty may arise as the shadow shape and movement is re-calculated frequently.
 *
 * This property can be used to control how often the shape and location of the shadow
 * should be updated. The value of this property indicates the number of update cycles
 * (usually the same as the number of frames) between successive updates of the shadow
 * volume shape and location.
 *
 * Setting the value of this property to one will cause the shape and location of the
 * shadow to be updated on every update to the locations of the node, light and camera
 * (ie- every frame). Setting the value of this property to an integer greater than one
 * will cause the update of the shadow to occur only once per that many updates to the
 * shadow-casting node, light and camera (ie- once per that number of frames), effectively
 * creating a lag between the movement of the shadow-casting node, and its shadow.
 *
 * The visible effect of this lag depends on the nature of the movement of the
 * shadow-casting node. In many situations, the lag will be unnoticable, or at least
 * acceptablly low. However, the lag can sometimes create self-shadowing effects on
 * the side of the node that is in shadow. The acceptability of this will depend on
 * whether the camera can move behind the node to view the sides that are in shadow,
 * and whether the self-shadow is visible on the darkened side.
 *
 * The use of a value larger than one for this property can often be particularly
 * useful for the shadows of skinned mesh nodes (bone-rigged characters), because
 * the calculations involved in updating the shape and motion of deformable meshes
 * are particularly performance-heavy, and the additional lag introduced by this
 * property is usually quite acceptable visually.
 *
 * When a number of shadows are being calculated, and the value of this property is set
 * to a value greater than one, the shadowLagCount property can be used to ensure that
 * all shadows are not calculated during the same update cycle, spreading the load of
 * calculating shadow updates for a number of mesh nodes across several update cycles.
 * See the notes of the shadowLagCount property for more info.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is one, indicating that the shadow shape and
 * motion will be updated on every update of the shadow-casting node, light or camera.
 *
 * The value of this property can only be changed after the shadow volumes have been added.
 *
 * Setting this value sets the same property on all descendant nodes that are shadows.
 *
 * Querying this property returns the first value greater than one from this property
 * from any descendant shadow node, or will return one if no shadow nodes are found
 * in the descendants of this node.

/**
 * Indicates the current number of update cycles to the shadow-casting node, light and
 * camera that must be processed before the shadow shape and movement will be updated.
 *
 * In order to improve performance, the shadowLagFactor property can be used to control
 * how often the shape and location of the shadow should be updated. The value of that
 * property indicates the number of update cycles (usually the same as the number of
 * frames) between successive updates of the shadow volume shape and location. This
 * introduces a lag between the movement of the shadow-casting node, and its shadow,
 * which in many cases will not be visibly significant See the notes of the
 * shadowLagFactor for more info about controlling this behaviour.
 *
 * The value of this property is decremented just before the updateBeforeTransform:
 * method is invoked during each update cycle, and when the value reaches zero, the
 * transform, shape, and location of the shadow will be recalculated. Once the
 * recalculation is complete, the value of this property is set to the value of the
 * shadowLagFactor, to being the update cycle countdown again.
 *
 * When the shadowLagFactor property is used to improve performance, to avoid having
 * all shadows updated in the same update cycle, setting the value of this property
 * to a different value across different shadow-casting nodes can help distribute the
 * load of calculating the shadows for a number of shadow-casting nodes across several
 * update cycles.
 *
 * In most cases, you do not need to set the value of this property directly. becuase
