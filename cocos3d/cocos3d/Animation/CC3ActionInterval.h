/**
 * Constants for use as action tags to identify an action of a particular type on a node.
 *
 * Assigning a tag to an action allows one type of action on a node to be stopped, while allowing
 * other actions on that node to continue. For instance, a node might be both moving and fading
 * in concurrently. If the movement is altered by a user interaction, it might be desirable to
 * stop the movement action and replace it, without affecting the fade action. Using a tag to
 * identify the movement action allows it to be retrieved and stopped (via stopActionByTag:)
 * without affecting the fade action.
 *
 * You can use the CC3Node convenience method  to stop any existing action on a node with a
 * particular tag, assign the tag to the new action, and run that action instead.
