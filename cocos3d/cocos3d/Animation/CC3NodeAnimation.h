#pragma mark CC3ArrayNodeAnimation

/** 
 * A concrete CC3NodeAnimation that holds animation data in simple arrays.
 * The arrays can be allocated and managed either by the instance, or externally.
 *
 * There are four properties that hold the animated data:
 *   - animatedLocations - location animation data
 *   - animatedRotations - rotation animation data
 *   - animatedQuaternions - rotation quaternion animation data
 *   - animatedScales - scale animation data
 *
 * You do not need to use all of these properties. You can choose to animate any
 * subset of these animation data properties, and leave the remaining animation data
 * properties set to NULL (the default). If you do not set an animation data property,
 * the corresponding property on the node will not be animated, and will retain its
 * originally set value.
 *
 * For instance, if you set only the animatedLocations property, and run a CC3Animate
 * on the node, only the location of the node will move around during the animation.
 * The remaining node properties (rotation, quaternion, scale) will remain unchanged
 * by the animation. The effect will be that the node moves around, but remains at
 * a fixed size, and oriented in a fixed rotation.
 
 * You can work with these animation data properties in one of two ways:
 *   - Allocate the arrays outside this class and simply assign them to this instance
 *     using the property accessors. In this case, it is up to you to allocate and
 *     deallocate the memory used by the arrays.
 *   - Invoke one or more of the methods allocateLocations, allocateRotations,
 *     allocateQuaternions, and allocateScales to instruct this instance to allocate
 *     and manage the memory for the data array. You can then access the associated
 *     array via the animatedLocations, animatedRotations, animatedQuaternions, and
 *     animatedScales properties respectively. This instance will take care of
 *     releasing the arrays when appropriate.
