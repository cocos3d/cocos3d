/**
 * A CC3VertexArrayMesh is a mesh whose mesh data is kept in a set of
 * CC3VertexArrays instances. Each of the contained CC3VertexArray instances manages the
 * data for one aspect of the vertices (locations, normals, colors, texture mapping...).
 *
 * Vertex data can be interleaved into a single underlying memory buffer that is shared
 * between the contained CC3VertexArrays, or it can be separated into distinct memory
 * buffers for each vertex aspect.
 *
 * The only vertex array that is required is the vertexLocations property. The others are
 * optional, depending on the nature of the mesh. If the vertexIndices property is provided,
 * it will be used during drawing. Otherwise, the vertices will be drawn in linear order
 * as they appear in the vertexLocations property.
 *
 * This class supports multi-texturing. In most situations, the mesh will use the
 * same texture mapping for all texture units. In this case, the single texture coordinates
 * array in the vertexTexureCoordinates property will be applied to all texture units.
 *
 * If multi-texturing is used, and separate texture coordinate mapping is required
 * for each texture unit, additional texture coordinate arrays can be added using the
 * addTextureCoordinates: method.
 *
 * For consistency, the addTextureCoordinates:, removeTextureCoordinates:, and
 * getTextureCoordinatesNamed: methods all interact with the vertexTextureCoordinates
 * property. If that property has not been set, the first texture coordinate array that
 * is added via addTextureCoordinates: will be set into the vertexTextureCoordinates
 * array. And the removeTextureCoordinates:, and getTextureCoordinatesNamed: methods
 * each check the vertexTextureCoordinates property as well as the overlayTextureCoordinates
 * collection. This design can simplify configurations in that all texture coordinate arrays
 * can be treated the same.
 *
 * If there are more textures applied to a node than there are texture coordinate arrays
 * in the mesh (including the vertexTextureCoordinates and the those in the
 * overlayTextureCoordinates collection), the last texture coordinate array is reused.
 *
 * This class supports covering the mesh with a repeating texture through the
 * repeatTexture: method.
 *
 * This class also supports covering the mesh with only a fractional part of the texture
 * through the use of the textureRectangle property, effectlivly permitting sprite-sheet
 * textures to be used with 3D meshes.
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3VertexArrayMesh instance, copies are not made of the
 * vertex arrays. Instead, they are retained by reference and shared between both the
 * original mesh, and the new copy.
 *
 * CC3VertexArrayMesh manages data for one contiguous set of vertices that can be
 * drawn with a single call to the GL engine, or a single set of draw-strip calls to the
 * GL engine, using the same materail properties. To assemble a large, complex mesh
 * containing several distinct vertex groups, assign each vertex group to its own
 * CC3VertexArrayMesh instance, wrap each mesh instance in a CC3MeshNode
 * instance, and create an structural assembly of the nodes. See the class notes for
 * CC3MeshNode for more information on assembling mesh nodes.

 */
@property(nonatomic, assign) BOOL shouldInterleaveVertices;

/**
 * Indicates the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Each vertex can contain several types of content, optionally including location, normal,
 * color, texture coordinates, along with other specialized content for certain specialized
 * meshes. To identify this various content, this property is a bitwise-OR of flags that
 * enumerate the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Valid component flags of this property include:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates
 *
 * To indicate that this mesh should contain particular vertex content, construct a
 * bitwise-OR combination of one or more of the component types listed above, and set
 * this property to that combined value.
 *
 * Setting each bitwise-OR component in this property instructs this instance to
 * automatically construct the appropriate type of contained vertex array:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation - automatically constructs a CC3VertexLocations instance in the
 *     vertexLocations property, that holds 3D vertex locations, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *     This component is optional, as the vertexLocations property will be constructed regardless.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal - automatically constructs a CC3VertexNormals instance in the
 *     vertexNormals property, that holds 3D vertex normals, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor - automatically constructs a CC3VertexColors instance in the vertexColors
 *     property, that holds RGBA colors with GLubyte components, in one ccColor4B structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates - automatically constructs a CC3VertexTextureCoordinates
 *     instance in the vertexTextureCoordinates property, that holds 2D texture coordinates, in one
 *     ccTex2F structure per vertex.
 * 
 * This property is a convenience property. Instead of using this property, you can create the
 * appropriate vertex arrays in those properties directly.
 * 
 * The vertex arrays constructed by this property will be configured to use interleaved data
 * if the shouldInterleaveVertices property is set to YES. You should ensure the value of the
 * shouldInterleaveVertices property to the desired value before setting the value of this property.
 * The initial value of the shouldInterleaveVertices property is YES.
 *
 * If the content is interleaved, for each vertex, the content is held in the structures identified in
 * the list above, in the order that they appear in the list. You can use this consistent organization
 * to create an enclosing structure to access all data for a single vertex, if it makes it easier to
 * access vertex data that way. If vertex content is not specified, it is simply absent, and the content
 * from the following type will be concatenated directly to the content from the previous type.
 *
 * For instance, if color content is not required, you would omit the kCC3VertexContentColor value when
 * setting this property, and the resulting structure for each vertex would be a location CC3Vector,
 * followed by a normal CC3Vector, followed immediately by a texture coordinate ccTex2F. You can then
 * define an enclosing structure to hold and manage all content for a single vertex. In this particular
 * example, this is already done for you with the CC3TexturedVertex structure.
 *
 * You can declare and use such a custom vertex structure even if you have constructed the vertex
 * arrays directly, without using this property. The structure of the content of a single vertex
 * is the same in either case.
 *
 * The vertex arrays created by this property cover the most common use cases and data formats.
 * If you require more customized vertex arrays, you can use this property to create the typical
 * vertex arrays, and then customize them, by accessing the vertex arrays individually through
 * their respective properties. After doing so, if the vertex data is interleaved, you should
 * invoke the updateVertexStride method on this instance to automatically align the elementOffset
 * and vertexStride properties of all of the contained vertex arrays. After setting this property,
 * you do not need to invoke the updateVertexStride method unless you subsequently make changes
 * to the constructed vertex arrays.
 *
 * It is safe to set this property more than once. Doing so will remove any existing vertex arrays
 * and replace them with those indicated by this property.
 * 
 * When reading this property, the appropriate bitwise-OR values are returned, corresponding
 * to the contained vertex arrays, even if those arrays were constructed directly, instead
 * of by setting this property. If this mesh contains no vertex arrays, this property will
 * return kCC3VertexContentNone.
