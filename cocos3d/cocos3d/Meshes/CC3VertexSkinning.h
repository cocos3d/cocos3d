#pragma mark CC3SoftBodyNode

/**
 * CC3SoftBodyNode is the primary structural component for a soft-body object that uses vertex
 * skinning to manipulate and draw mesh vertices.
 *
 * Vertex skinning is a feature of OpenGL that allows the vertices of a mesh to be manipulated
 * or deformed using an underlying skeleton of bones. This feature is also sometimes referred
 * to as bone-rigging. This feature is used to create realistic movement in soft-body, flexible
 * meshes, such as characters or textiles.
 *
 * A soft-body object consists of two primary components: a skeletal structure, and the skin
 * that covers it. The skeletal structure is constructed from an assembly of CC3Bone instances,
 * and the skin is constructed from one or more CC3SkinMeshNode instances. The CC3SoftBodyNode
 * instance then serves to collect together the bones and skin components, and forms the root
 * of the soft-body object.
 * 
 * The vertices of the skin mesh forms the skin that surrounds the bones of the skeleton.
 * During movement and drawing, the location and rotation of each bone in the skeleton 
 * influences the locations of the skin vertices that are attached to that bone. Some skin
 * vertices, particularly those around joints where two bones meet, can be associated with
 * more than one bone, and in that case, the influence that each bone has on the location 
 * of a vertex is determined by a weighting associated with each bone for that vertex.
 *
 * The CC3Bone instances are typically assembled into a structural assembly of bones known
 * as a skeleton. The purpose of this skeletal structure is to allow the bones to move and
 * interact with each other in a hierarchical manner.
 *
 * A CC3SkinMeshNode instance represents the skin that covers the skeleton, and contains the
 * mesh that makes up the skin. This mesh includes the bone assignments and weights for each
 * vertex, which specifies how the location of each vertex is influenced by the location and
 * orientation of each nearby bone.
 *
 * A single soft-body object may be covered by a single skin mesh, but more complicated objects
 * may be covered by several skin meshes. As such, a single CC3SoftBodyNode instance may contain
 * one or more CC3SkinMeshNode instances.
 * 
 * For efficiency and control, each skin mesh is usually broken into sections. These skin 
 * sections are represented by instances of the CC3SkinSection class. A CC3SkinMeshNode
 * typically holds a single mesh and several CC3SkinSection instances to define how that mesh
 * should be divided into sections. Each CC3SkinSection instance contains a range of vertices,
 * and references to the bones in the skeleton that influence the vertices in that range.
 * All of the vertices of a single CC3SkinSection are drawn in a single GL drawing call.
 *
 * Manipulation of the bones in the skeleton will cause the soft-body to move and flex 
 * internally. In addition, like any node, a CC3SoftBodyNode can be moved, rotated and 
 * scaled to move, rotate and scale the entire soft-body assembly of skin and bones as
 * a unit. By combining both internal bone animation with movement of the entire
 * CC3SoftBodyNode, you can create realistic movement of your soft-body objects.
 *
 * For example, if your CC3SoftBodyNode represents a character, you could animate the bones
 * in the skeleton within the node to crouch down and then stand up again. During the standing
 * up animation, you could move the entire CC3SoftBodyNode upwards to create a realistic jumping
 * action. Or, you could simply animate the bones in the skeleton through a loop of a step of a
 * walking motion, while at the same time moving the CC3SoftBodyNode forward, making it appear
 * that the character was walking forward.
 *
 * The initial assembly of CC3Bone nodes should be arranged into what is termed the "rest pose".
 * This is the alignment of the bones that will fit the undeformed positions of the vertices that
 * make up the skin. In the rest pose, the bones have no deforming effect on the skin vertices.
 * 
 * Once the initial skeleton has been assembled into the rest pose, you should invoke 
 * the bindRestPose method on the CC3SoftBodyNode instance (or any ancestor node of the
 * CC3SoftBodyNode instance) to cause the bones to cache this pose.
 * 
 * Subsequent movement of the bones in the skeleton deform the skin vertices relative to this
 * rest pose, affecting the location of the vertices in the mesh.
 *
 * In almost all soft-body objects, all internal movement of the object is handled via
 * manipulation of the bones. The CC3SkinMeshNodes should not be moved or rotated directly,
 * relative to the surrounding CC3SoftBodyNode, otherwise the skin will become detached
 * from the bones. However, if you have reason to move the skin mesh nodes relative to
 * the soft-body node, you should re-establish the rest pose and invoke the bindRestPose
 * method again to re-align the bones with the skin.
 *
 * If the CC3SoftBodyNode has been assembled from a file loader, the bindRestPose method
 * will usually be invoked automatically, and you do not need to invoke it explicitly.

#pragma mark CC3SkinMeshNode

/**
 * CC3SkinMeshNode is a CC3MeshNode specialized to use vertex skinning to draw the contents
 * of its mesh. It is one of the key structural descendant nodes of a CC3SoftBodyNode instance.
 *
 * The CC3SkinMeshNode contains a collection of skin sections, in the form of CC3SkinSection
 * instances. Each CC3SkinSection instance relates a section of the mesh, in the form of a 
 * range of vertices, to a set of bones in the skeleton.
 * 
 * Each CC3SkinSection applies the transformations in the referenced bones to the the vertices
 * in the section of the mesh that it controls, and draws that section of the mesh by drawing
 * the vertices within its range in a single GL call.
 * 
 * After copying a CC3SkinMeshNode, the newly created copy will still be influenced by the 
 * original skeleton. The result is that both the original mesh and the copy will move and 
 * be deformed in tandem as the skeleton moves.
 *
 * If you are creating a chorus line of dancing characters, this may be the effect you are after.
 * However, if you are creating a squadron of similar, but independently moving, characters, each
 * CC3SkinMeshNode copy should be controlled by a separate skeleton. To do this, after creating
 * a copy of the skeleton bone node assembly as well, you can use the reattachBonesFrom: method
 * to attach the skin mesh node to the new skeleton.
 *
 * When copying a CC3SkinMeshNode as part of copying a CC3SoftBodyNode instance, a copy of 
 * the skeleton is also created, and the reattachBonesFrom: method is automatically invoked.
 * When copying CC3SoftBodyNode, you do not need to invoke the reattachBonesFrom: method on
 * the new CC3SkinMeshNode directly.
 *
 * The use of bounding volumes with skinned meshes can be tricky, because the locations of
 * the vertices are affected both by the location of the mesh node, as with any mesh, but
 * also by the location of the bones. In addition, bone transformation is handled by the
 * GPU, and unless the CPU is also tasked with transforming each vertex, it is difficult
 * for the app to know the true range of the vertices.
 *
 * Because of this, the createBoundingVolumes method will be ignored by instances of this
 * class, and a bounding volume will not automatically be assigned to this node, to ensure
 * that the mesh will not be culled when it shouldn't if the automatic bounding volume is
 * not the correct shape. This mesh will therefore be drawn for each frame, even if it is
 * not in front of the camera (ie- inside the camera's frustum).
 *
 * It is left to the application to determine the best approach to managing the assignment
 * of a bounding volume, possibly using one of the following approaches:
 *
 *   - You can choose to leave this node with no bounding volume, and allow it to be drawn
 *     on each frame. This may be the easiest approach if performance is not critical.
 *
 *   - For a CC3SkinMeshNode, the bounding volume that is created automatically when the
 *     createBoundingVolume method is invoked forms a sphere around the rest pose of the mesh.
 *     A spherical bounding volume is used because, for many bone-rigged characters, the bones
 *     remain within a sphere determmined by the rest pose. If you know that the vertices of 
 *     the skinned mesh node will not move beyond the static bounding volume defined by the
 *     vertices in the rest pose, you can invoke the createBoundingVolume method to have a
 *     spherical bounding volume created automatically from the rest pose of this node. 
 *     If this is a common requirement, you can also use the createSkinnedBoundingVolumes
 *     method on any ancestor node to have a spherical bounding volume automatically created
 *     for each descendant skinned mesh node.
 *
 *   - You can manually create a bounding volume of the right size and shape for the movement
 *     of the vertices from the perspective of a root bone of the skeleton. Assign the bounding
 *     volume to the root bone by using the boundingVolume property on the root bone and,
 *     once it has been assigned a root bone of the skeleton, use the setSkeletalBoundingVolume:
 *     method on an ancestor node of all of the CC3SkinMeshNodes that are to use that bounding
 *     volume, to assign that bounding volume to all of the appropriate CC3SkinMeshNodes.
 *     A good choice to target for the invocation of this method might be the CC3SoftBodyNode
 *     of the model, or even the CC3ResourceNode above it, if loaded from a file. During
 *     development, you can use the shouldDrawBoundingVolume property to make the bounding
 *     volume visible, to aid in determining and setting the right size and shape for it.
