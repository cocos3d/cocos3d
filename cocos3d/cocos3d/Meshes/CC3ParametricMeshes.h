#pragma mark Populating parametric triangles

/**
 * Populates this instance as a simple triangular mesh.
 *
 * The specified face defines the three vertices at the corners of the triangular mesh in 3D space.
 * The vertices within the CC3Face structure are specified in the winding order of the triangular
 * face. The winding order of the specified face determines the winding order of the vertices in
 * the mesh, and the direction of the normal vector applied to each of the vertices. Since the
 * resulting triangular mesh is flat, all vertices will have the same normal vector.
 
 * Although the triangle can be created with the corners can be anywhere in 3D space, for simplicity
 * of construction, it is common practice, when using this method, to specify the mesh in the X-Y
 * plane (where all three corners have a zero Z-component), and then rotate the node containing this
 * mesh to an orientation in 3D space.
 *
 * The texCoords parameter is an array of ccTex2F structures, providing the texture coordinates for
 * the cooresponding vertices of the face. This array must have three elements, one for each vertex
 * in the specified face. If the mesh will not be covered with a texture, you can pass in any values
 * in the elements of this array.
 *
 * The tessellation property determines how the mesh will be tessellated into smaller faces. The
 * specified tessellation value indicates how many divisions each side of the main triangle should
 * be divided into. Each side of the triangular mesh is tessellated into the same number of divisions.
 *
 * This mesh can be covered with a solid material or a single texture. If this mesh is to be covered
 * with a texture, use the texture property of this mesh to set the texture. If a solid color is
 * desired, leave the texture property unassigned.
 *
 * The vertexContentType property of this mesh may be set prior to invoking this method, to define the
 * content type for each vertex. Content types kCC3VertexContentLocation, kCC3VertexContentNormal, and
 * kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate are populated by this method.
 *
 * If the vertexContentType property has not already been set, that property is set to a value of
 * (kCC3VertexContentLocation | kCC3VertexContentNormal | kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate), and
 * the mesh will be populated with location, normal and texture coordinates for each vertex.

 *
 * The surface of the disk is divided into many smaller divisions, both in the radial and angular dimensions.
 *
 * The radialAndAngleDivs argument indicates how to divide the surface of the disks into divisions.
 * The X element of the radialAndAngleDivs argument indicates how many radial divisions will occur
 * from the center and the circuferential edge. A value of one means that the mesh will consist of

 * 
 * The Y element of the radialAndAngleDivs argument indicates how many angular divisions will occur
 * around the circumference. This value must be at least three, which will essentially render the
 * circle as a triangle. But, typically, this value will be larger.
 * 
 * For example, a value of {4,24} for the radialAndAngleDivs argument will result in the disk being
 * divided into four concentric rings, each divided into 24 segments around the circumference of the circle.
 * 
 * Each segement, except those in the innermost disk is trapezoidal, and will be constructed from two

 * you are texturing the box with a simple rectangular repeating pattern and want the texture to appear
 * consistent across the sides, for example, a brick pattern wrapping around all four sides of a house.
 *
 * Depending on the relative aspect of the height and width of the box, the texture may appear distorted
 * horizontal or vertically. If you need to correct that, you can use the repeatTexture: method, and

 *
 * For higher fidelity in applying textures to non-cube boxes, so that the texture will not be stretched

 * The corner argument is specified as a fraction in each of the S & T dimensions of the texture.
 * In the CGPoint that specifies the corner, the x & y elements of the CGPoint correspond to the S & T
 * dimensions of this left-front-bottom corner mapping, with each value being between zero and one.
 *
 * Since, by definition, opposite sides of the box have the same dimensions, this single corner point
 * identifies the S & T dimensions of all six of the sides of the box. A value of (1/4, 1/3) for the
 * corner is used when the box is a cube. A smaller value for the x-element would move the corner to
 * the left in the texture layout, indicating that the left and right sides are shallower than they
 * are in a cube, and that the front and back are wider than in a cube, and vice-versa for a larger
 * value in the x-element of the corner. Similarly for the y-element. A y-element that is smaller
 * than 1/3, moves the corner point downwards on the texture, indicating that the bottom and top are
 * shallower than they are in a cube, or that the front and back are higher than they are in a cube.
 *
 * The two axes defined by the corner are interrelated, because the sides need to be the same depth as
 * the top and bottom. The best way to determine the values to use in the corner is to use the measure
 * of this point (where the "left", "front", and "bottom" sides meet) from the layout of the texture.

#pragma mark Populating for bitmapped font textures

/**
 * Populates this instance as a rectangular mesh displaying the text of the specified string,
 * built from bitmap character images taken from a texture atlas as defined by the specified
 * bitmapped font configuration.
 *
 * The texture that matches the specified font configuration (and identified in the font configuration),
 * should be loaded and assigned to the texture property of the mesh node that uses this mesh.
 *
 * The text may be multi-line, and can be left-, center- or right-aligned, as specified.
 *
 * The specified lineHeight define the height of a line of text in the coordinate system of this
 * mesh. This parameter can be set to zero to use the natural line height of the font.
 *
 * For example, a font with font size of 16 might have a natural line height of 19. Setting the
 * lineHeight parameter to zero would result in a mesh where a line of text would be 19 units high.
 * On the other hand, setting this property to 0.2 will result in a mesh where the same line of text
 * has a height of 0.2 units. Depending on the size of other models in your scene, you may want to
 * set this lineHeight to something compatible. In addition, the visual size of the text will also
 * be affected by the value of the scale or uniformScale properties of any mesh node using this mesh.
 * Both the lineHeight and the node scale work to establish the visual size of the label text.
 *
 * For a more granular mesh, each character rectangle can be divided into many smaller divisions.
 * Building a rectanglular surface from more than one division can dramatically improve realism
 * when the surface is illuminated with specular lighting or a tightly focused spotlight, or if
 * the mesh is to be deformed in some way by a later process (such as wrapping the text texture
 * around some other shape).
 *
 * The divsPerChar argument indicates how to break each character rectangle into multiple faces.
 * The X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument indicate how each axis if the rectangle for each
 * character should be divided into faces. The number of faces in the rectangle for each character
 * will therefore be the multiplicative product of the X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument.
 *
 * For example, a value of {3,2} for the divsPerChar argument will result in each character being
 * divided into 6 smaller rectangular faces, arranged into a 3x2 grid.
 *
 * The relative origin defines the location of the origin for texture alignment, and is specified
 * as a fraction of the size of the overall label layout, starting from the bottom-left corner.
 *
 * For example, origin values of (0, 0), (0.5, 0.5), and (1, 1) indicate that the label mesh should
 * be aligned so that the bottom-left corner, center, or top-right corner, respectively, should be
 * located at the local origin of the corresponding mesh.
 *
 * The vertexContentType property of this mesh may be set prior to invoking this method, to define the
 * content type for each vertex. Content types kCC3VertexContentLocation, kCC3VertexContentNormal, and
 * kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate are populated by this method.
 *
 * If the vertexContentType property has not already been set, that property is set to a value of
 * (kCC3VertexContentLocation | kCC3VertexContentNormal | kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate), and
 * the mesh will be populated with location, normal and texture coordinates for each vertex.
 *
 * This method may be invoked repeatedly to change the label string. The mesh will automomatically
 * be rebuilt to the correct number of vertices required to display the currently specified string.
