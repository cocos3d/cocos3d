/**
 * A CC3Mesh holds the 3D mesh for a CC3MeshNode.
 *
 * In 3D models, the mesh generally remains fixed, and transformations such as translation,
 * rotation, and scaling are applied at the node level. A single CC3Mesh instance, which
 * typically contains a large set of data points, can be used by many nodes simultaneously,
 * and each node instance can be transformed, colored, and textured independently.
 *
 * With this in mind, and following best practices to consevere memory and processing time,
 * you should strive to create only one CC3Mesh instance for each distinct mesh in your
 * application, and assign that single CC3Mesh instance to any number of separate CC3MeshNode
 * instances that make use of it.

 *
 * The vertex content in this mesh is kept in a set of CC3VertexArrays instances. Each of
 * the contained CC3VertexArray instances manages the data for one aspect of the vertices
 * (locations, normals, colors, texture mapping, bone weights...).
 *
 * Vertex data can be interleaved into a single underlying memory buffer that is shared
 * between the contained CC3VertexArrays, or it can be separated into distinct memory
 * buffers for each vertex aspect.
 *
 * The only vertex array that is required is the vertexLocations property. The others are
 * optional, depending on the nature of the mesh. If the vertexIndices property is provided,
 * it will be used during drawing. If ther vertexIndices property is nil, the vertices will
 * be drawn in linear order as they appear in the vertexLocations property.
 *
 * This class supports multi-texturing. In most situations, the mesh will use the same texture
 * mapping for all texture units. In this case, the single texture coordinates array in the
 * vertexTexureCoordinates property will be applied to all textures in the material applied
 * to a CC3MeshNode using this mesh.
 *
 * If multi-texturing is used, and separate texture coordinate mapping is required for each texture
 * unit, additional texture coordinate arrays can be added using the addTextureCoordinates: method.
 *
 * For consistency, the addTextureCoordinates:, removeTextureCoordinates:, and
 * getTextureCoordinatesNamed: methods all interact with the vertexTextureCoordinates
 * property. If that property has not been set, the first texture coordinate array that
 * is added via addTextureCoordinates: will be set into the vertexTextureCoordinates
 * array. And the removeTextureCoordinates:, and getTextureCoordinatesNamed: methods
 * each check the vertexTextureCoordinates property as well as the overlayTextureCoordinates
 * collection. This design can simplify configurations in that all texture coordinate arrays
 * can be treated the same.
 *
 * If there are more textures applied to a node than there are texture coordinate arrays
 * in the mesh (including the vertexTextureCoordinates and the those in the
 * overlayTextureCoordinates collection), the last texture coordinate array is reused.
 *
 * This class supports covering the mesh with a repeating texture through the repeatTexture: method.
 *
 * This class also supports covering the mesh with only a fractional part of the texture
 * through the use of the textureRectangle property, effectlivly permitting sprite-sheet
 * textures to be used with 3D meshes.
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3Mesh instance, copies are not made of the vertex arrays. Instead,
 * they are retained by reference and shared between both the original mesh, and the new copy.
 *
 * CC3Mesh manages data for one contiguous set of vertices that can be drawn with a single call
 * to the GL engine, or a single set of draw-strip calls to the GL engine, using the same material
 * properties. To assemble a large, complex mesh containing several distinct vertex groups, assign
 * each vertex group to its own CC3Mesh instance, wrap each mesh instance in a CC3MeshNode instance,
 * and create an structural assembly of the nodes. See the class notes for CC3MeshNode for more
 * information on assembling mesh nodes.
 *
 * When drawing the mesh to the GL engine, this class remembers which mesh was last drawn
 * and only binds the mesh data to the GL engine when a different mesh is drawn. This allows
 * the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3Scene so that nodes using the
 * same mesh are drawn together, before moving on to other mesh models. This strategy
 * can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine, which improves performance. 
 *
 * CC3Mesh is an abstract class. Subclasses can be created for loading and managing
 * meshes from different sources and third-party libraries.

 * meshes. To identify this various content, this property is a bitwise-OR of flags that
 * enumerate the types of content contained in each vertex of this mesh.
 *
 * Valid component flags of this property include:
 *   - kCC3VertexContentLocation
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal

 * To indicate that this mesh should contain particular vertex content, construct a

 * this property to that combined value.
 *

 *     vertexLocations property, that holds 3D vertex locations, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *     This component is optional, as the vertexLocations property will be constructed regardless.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentNormal - automatically constructs a CC3VertexNormals instance in the
 *     vertexNormals property, that holds 3D vertex normals, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTangent - automatically constructs a CC3VertexTangents instance in the
 *     vertexTangents property, that holds 3D vertex tangents, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBitangent - automatically constructs a CC3VertexTangents instance in the
 *     vertexBitangents property, that holds 3D vertex tangents, in one CC3Vector structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentColor - automatically constructs a CC3VertexColors instance in the vertexColors
 *     property, that holds RGBA colors with GLubyte components, in one ccColor4B structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinates - automatically constructs a CC3VertexTextureCoordinates
 *     instance in the vertexTextureCoordinates property, that holds 2D texture coordinates, in one
 *     ccTex2F structure per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBoneWeights - automatically constructs a CC3VertexBoneWeights instance
 *     in the vertexBoneWeights property, that holds several GLfloat values per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentBoneIndices - automatically constructs a CC3VertexBoneIndices instance
 *     in the vertexBoneIndices property, that holds several GLubyte or GLushort values per vertex.
 *   - kCC3VertexContentPointSize - automatically constructs a CC3VertexPointSizes
 *     instance in the vertexPointSizes property, that holds one GLfloat per vertex.
 *
 * This property is a convenience property. Instead of using this property, you can create the
 * appropriate vertex arrays in those properties directly.
 *
 * The vertex arrays constructed by this property will be configured to use interleaved data
 * if the shouldInterleaveVertices property is set to YES. You should ensure the value of the
 * shouldInterleaveVertices property to the desired value before setting the value of this property.
 * The initial value of the shouldInterleaveVertices property is YES.
 *
 * If the content is interleaved, for each vertex, the content is held in the structures identified in
 * the list above, in the order that they appear in the list. You can use this consistent organization
 * to create an enclosing structure to access all data for a single vertex, if it makes it easier to
 * access vertex content that way. If vertex content is not specified, it is simply absent, and the content
 * from the following type will be concatenated directly to the content from the previous type.
 *
 * For instance, in a typical textured and illuminated mesh, you might not require per-vertex
 * color, tangent and bitangent content. You would therefore omit the kCC3VertexContentColor,
 * kCC3VertexContentTangent and kCC3VertexContentBitangent values in the bitmask when setting
 * this property, and the resulting structure for each vertex would be a location CC3Vector,
 * followed by a normal CC3Vector, followed immediately by a texture coordinate ccTex2F.
 * You can then define an enclosing structure to hold and manage all content for a single vertex.
 * In this particular example, this is already done for you with the CC3TexturedVertex structure.
 *
 * You can declare and use such a custom vertex structure even if you have constructed the vertex
 * arrays directly, without using this property. The structure of the content of a single vertex
 * is the same in either case.
 *
 * The vertex arrays created by this property cover the most common use cases and data formats.
 * If you require more customized vertex arrays, you can use this property to create the typical
 * vertex arrays, and then customize them, by accessing the vertex arrays individually through
 * their respective properties. After doing so, if the vertex content is interleaved, you should
 * invoke the updateVertexStride method on this instance to automatically align the elementOffset
 * and vertexStride properties of all of the contained vertex arrays. After setting this property,
 * you do not need to invoke the updateVertexStride method unless you subsequently make changes
 * to the constructed vertex arrays.
 *
 * It is safe to set this property more than once. Doing so will remove any existing vertex arrays
 * and replace them with those indicated by this property.
 *
 * When reading this property, the appropriate bitwise-OR values are returned, corresponding
 * to the contained vertex arrays, even if those arrays were constructed directly, instead
 * of by setting this property. If this mesh contains no vertex arrays, this property will
 * return kCC3VertexContentNone.
