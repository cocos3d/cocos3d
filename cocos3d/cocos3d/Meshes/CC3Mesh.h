/**
 * A CC3Mesh holds the 3D mesh for a CC3MeshNode. The CC3MeshNode enapsulates a reference

 *
 * In 3D models, the mesh generally remains fixed, and transformations such as translation,
 * rotation, and scaling are applied at the node level. A single CC3Mesh instance, which
 * typically contains a large set of data points, can be used by many nodes simultaneously,
 * and each node instance can be transformed, colored, and textured independently.
 *
 * With this in mind, and following best practices to consevere memory and processing time,
 * you should strive to create only one CC3Mesh instance for each distinct mesh in your
 * application, and assign that single CC3Mesh instance to any number of separate
 * CC3MeshNode instances that make use of it.
 *
 * When drawing the mesh to the GL engine, this class remembers which mesh was last drawn
 * and only binds the mesh data to the GL engine when a different mesh is drawn. This allows
 * the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3Scene so that nodes using the
 * same mesh are drawn together, before moving on to other mesh models. This strategy
 * can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine, which improves performance. 
 *
 * CC3Mesh is an abstract class. Subclasses can be created for loading and managing
 * meshes from different sources and third-party libraries.

 * animating a texture onto a mesh, where each section of the full texture is really
 * a different frame of a texture animation, or simply loading one larger texture
 * and using parts of it to texture many different meshes.
 *
 * The dimensions of this rectangle are taken as fractional portions of the full
 * area of the texture. Therefore, a rectangle with zero origin, and unit size
 * ((0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)) indicates that the mesh should be covered with the
 * complete texture.

 * that only the top-right quarter of the texture will be used to cover this mesh.
 *
 * The bounds of the texture rectangle must fit within a unit rectangle. Both the

 * X and Y directions.
 *
 * The dimensions of the rectangle in this property are independent of adjustments
 * made by the  alignWithTexturesIn: and alignWithInvertedTexturesIn: methods.
 * A unit rectangle value for this property will automatically take into
 * consideration the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will display
 * only the part of the texture defined by them. Rectangular values for this property
 * that are smaller than the unit rectangle will be relative to the displayable area
 * defined by alignWithTexturesIn: and alignWithInvertedTexturesIn:.
 *
 * As an example, if the alignWithTexturesIn: method was used to limit the mesh
 * to using only 80% of the texture (perhaps when using a non-POT texture), and this
 * property was set to a rectangle with origin at (0.5, 0.0) and size (0.5, 0.5),
 * the mesh will be covered by the bottom-right quarter of the usable 80% of the
 * overall texture.

 * this property for a single texture unit only, use the textureRectangleForTextureUnit:

 * pierces a face from its back face. Typically, this means that the ray has intersected the face
 * as the ray exits on the far side of the mesh. In most cases you will interested only where the
 * ray intersects the near side of the mesh, in which case you can set this parameter to NO.
 *
 * The allowBehind parameter is used to indicate whether to include intersections that occur behind
 * the startLocation of the ray, in the direction opposite to the direction of the ray. Typically,
 * this might mean the mesh is located behind the ray startLocation, or it might mean the ray starts
 * inside the mesh. Again,in most cases, you will be interested only in intersections that occur in
