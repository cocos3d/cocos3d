/**
 * Given the corners of the triagular face (c0, c1, c2), the barycentric weights are determined by
 * transforming the origin of the coordinate system to the first corner of the triangular face (c0).
 * 
 * We can write an equation for the specified location of interest (p), using c0 as the origin
 * and the two sides projecting from c0 as basis vectors:
 *    p = c0 + b1(c1 - c0) + b2(c2 - c0)
 *
 * Subtract c0 from both sides to translate to a coordinate system with c0 at the origin, and
 * substitute vectors vp, v1 & v2 to represent the the vectors from c0:
 *    (p - c0) = b1(c1 - c0) + b2(c2 - c0)
 *    vp = b1(v1) + b2(v2)
 * 
 * To solve for b1 & b2, we need two equations, which we can get by dotting both sides of this
 * equation by v1 to create one equation and by v2 to create the other equation:
 *    vp.v1 = b1(v1.v1) + b2(v2.v1)
 *    vp.v2 = b1(v1.v2) + b2(v2.v2)
 *
 * Solving for b1 & b2:
 *    b1 = ((v2.v2)(vp.v1) - (v2.v1)(vp.v2)) / d
 *    b2 = ((v1.v1)(vp.v2) - (v1.v2)(vp.v1)) / d
 * where:
 *    d = (v1.v1)(v2.v2) - (v1.v2)(v2.v1)
 *
 * We know have two of the three barycentric coordinates. We can get the third by expanding
 * the original equation and collecting like terms:
 *    p = c0 + b1(c1 - c0) + b2(c2 - c0)
 *    p = c0 + b1(c1) - b2(c0) + b2(c2) - b2(c0)
 *    p = (1 - b1 - b2)(c0) + b1(c1) + b2(c2)
 *    p = b0(c0) + b1(c1) + b2(c2)
