/**
 * CC3ModelSampleFactory is a convenience utility for creating sample 3D models
 * for experimentation.
 * 
 * The design pattern is a singleton factory object, with methods for creating
 * instances of various 3D models.
 *
 * Access to the factory instance is through the factory class method.
 *
 * This class should be considered for testing and experimental use only.
 * Unless you really need teapots in your application, there is no need to include
 * this class, or the teapot.h data header file, in any finished application.
 * Doing so will just bloat the size of the application unnecessarily.
