/**
 * CC3MultiTemplateMeshParticleEmitter is a type of CC3MeshParticleEmitter that supports multiple
 * particle template meshes, one of which can be selected and assigned to each particle as it is
 * emitted.
 *
 * Multiple particle templates can be added to this emitter using the addParticleTemplateMesh:
 * method. The implementation of the assignTemplateMeshToParticle: method defines how a particular
 * template mesh is selected by the emitter and assigned to a particle as it is being emitted.
 *
 * For particles created by the application outside the emitter, and added to the emitter with the
 * emitParticle: method, the application can directly set the templateMesh property of the mesh
 * particle prior to invoking the emitParticle: method of this emitter. With this technique, each
 * particle can use a different mesh template, and so each paticle can be a different shape.
 * If the templateMesh property of a particle submitted to the emitParticle: method is nil, this
 * emitter will select one of the particle templates that have been added to this emitter, and
 * assign it to the particle.
 *
 * For particles created within the emitter, and emitted automatically, or via the emitParticle
 * method, this emitter will select one of the particle templates that have been added to this
 * emitter, and assign it to the particle. In this scenario, each particle will be the same shape.
 *
 * This class inherits the particleTemplateMesh property from CC3MeshParticleEmitter. If that
 * property has also been set, mesh selection will be made from the set of meshes comprised of
 * the template meshes added with the addParticleTemplateMesh: method, and the template mesh
 * assigned to the particleTemplateMesh property.

 * is selected and assigned as the templateMesh of the particle before it is initialized.
 * The particle template mesh is assigned by the assignTemplateMeshToParticle: method.
